Surfing is a surface water pastime in which the wave rider, referred to as a surfer, 
rides on the forward part, or face, of a moving wave, which usually carries the 
surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found in the 
ocean, but can also be found in lakes or rivers in the form of a standing wave or 
tidal bore. However, surfers can also utilize artificial waves such as those from 
boat wakes and the waves created in artificial wave pools.
The term surfing usually refers to the act of riding a wave using a board,
regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards. The native peoples
of the Pacific, for instance, surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such
craft, and did so on their belly and knees. The modern-day definition of
surfing, however, most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing on a
surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.
