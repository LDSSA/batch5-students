# Big Learning Unit 3 - Data Sources


## What is in this BLU?

#### Main topics

- Relational Databases and SQL (Structured Query Language)
- HTTP requests and public APIs
- HTML and Web scraping

#### Summary

This is the third and final BLU in the Data Wrangling specialization. It will teach you about different sources of data and how to extract information from them.

You will start by learning about SQL (Structured Query Language), a language which allows you to interact with databases in different ways. Databases are commonly used as storage for many different types of data and as such, obtaining information from them is an essential skill for any data scientist.

Afterwards, you will learn about how to extract data from the Web. First, you will learn about the protocol used for data communication in the Web, HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), so you can request information from public web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). Finally, you will learn the basics of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language - the standard language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser) and web scraping (the process of collecting data from web pages in an automated way).

Good luck!
