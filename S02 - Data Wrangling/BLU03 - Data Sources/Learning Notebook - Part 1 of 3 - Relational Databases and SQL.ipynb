    "In this notebook, we'll start by learning about databases. There are different types of databases, but here we'll focus on relational databases. In that context, we'll talk about tables and how different tables can relate with each other.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 2. What is a Database\n",
    "\n",
    "Generically, a [**database**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) is an organized collection of data. By this definition, a teenager's diary or an excel spreadsheet are examples of databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, a database by itself is of little relevance. We are actually only interested in databases supported by a **database-management system** (DBMS). These are software applications that allow end-users and other applications to interact with the stored data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"media/dbms.png\" width=500/>\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have heard about some popular DBMSs, like PostgreSQL, MySQL or SQLite.\n",
    "\n",
    "From now on, when we mention a database, we will be referring to the **combination of the actual database and its corresponding DBMS.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "We can separate databases in two groups: **relational** and **non-relational** databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relational databases\n",
    "\n",
    "In a relational database, we model the data through tables and relationships between them. It may sound a little vague now, but it will start making sense once we look at some examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "When talking about relational databases, it is fundamental to also talk about [**SQL**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL). It stands for **S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage, and as the name suggests, it's a language used to interact with these kinds of databases. As a result, relational databases are often called **SQL databases**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Non-relational databases\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different types of non-relational databases, such as key-value databases, document databases or graph databases.\n",
    "As opposed to SQL databases, non-relational databases are often called [**NoSQL**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) **databases**. In this notebook we will only be talking about relational databases and SQL, but you should definitely check out NoSQL databases if you have the time!"

    "* **rows** (a.k.a. **records**), that aggregate the data of a **single entry** of the entity being modeled\n",

    "\n",
    "Similarly to what we saw in pandas DataFrames, each column has a unique data type, i.e. all the values in a column have the same data type.\n",
    "There are different data types to choose from, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. INTEGER    - integer numeric\n",
    "2. FLOAT      - decimal numeric\n",
    "3. VARCHAR(n) - character string with variable length, up to n characters\n",
    "4. DATE       - stores year, month, day \n",
    "5. TIMESTAMP  - stores year, month, day, hour, minute, second, millisecond...\n",
    "6. BOOLEAN    - true or false\n",
    "\n",
    "Our movie table has the following data types:\n",
    "* *id* - INTEGER\n",
    "* *original_title* - VARCHAR(255)\n",
    "* *release_date* - TIMESTAMP\n",
    "* *budget* - INTEGER\n",

    "### 4.3 Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "In SQL tables, we can impose some constraints on the columns' values. These constraints are like rules that determine if a certain value may belong to a column or not. The most frequent constraints are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **NOT NULL**: a column with this constraint may not have NULL values\n",
    "* **UNIQUE**: a column with this constraint may not have duplicate values\n",
    "* **DEFAULT**: when inserting records in the table, if no value is specified for this column, a default value will be used\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.4 Indexes\n",
    "\n",
    "An index in SQL works like an index in a book: it's a guide to help to find the value you're searching for in a faster way.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's very useful to have indexed columns in tables that are consulted frequently. The downside is that inserting, deleting or updating data in such tables is slower, as they need to be reindexed when the data changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.5 Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "Keys are used to identify records in a table and also to create relationships among different tables.\n",
    "The two most important types of keys are the **primary key** and the **foreign key**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary key**\n",
    "\n",
    "A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table.\n",
    "It can be one column or a combination of multiple columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, it must respect the UNIQUE and NOT NULL constraints, in order to uniquely identify a record in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a primary key is column *id* in the movie table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Foreign key**\n",
    "\n",
    "A foreign key is a column (or a combination of columns) used to link the table with other tables. The foreign key references the primary key in another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see an example. In the MoviesDb, we have other tables besides the movie table. One of them is the `oscar` table, that stores the winners of the Best Picture Oscar since 1929:\n",
    "\n",
    "id |year |movie_id |\n",
    "---|-----|---------|\n",
    "1  |1929 |1817     |\n",
    "2  |1930 |1818     |\n",
    "\n",
    "In this table, column *id* is the table's primary key and column *movie_id* is a foreign key that references the primary key of the movie table."

    "The most common aggregate functions are **COUNT**, **AVG**, **MIN** and **MAX**, and each of them does exactly what its name indicates. [Here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/functions-aggregate.html) you can find a list with all the aggregate functions in PostgreSQL. In other DBMSs the available aggregate functions should be similar.\n",

Then, you can divide this information into tables, defining each table's primary key and the relationships between tables (i.e. the foreign keys). There are several other more advanced design guidelines and best practices (naming conventions, normalization, which columns to index...). You can find many resources online on this topic, if you're interested in exploring further."
