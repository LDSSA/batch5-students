# Big Learning Unit 15 - Model CSI

## New concepts in this unit

This is the third unit of DS in the Real World specialization. In this learning unit you're going to find out how to diagnose an existing model, identify issues and redeploy the model.

In part 1 you'll learn:

- What causes a model to underperform over time
- Detecting changes on data
- Manual versus automated model retraining
- What data to use to retrain

In part 2 we'll get more practical with:

- Model diagnosing (for performance and client requirements)
- Calibrating and fixing model problems
- Redeploying the model

## How to go through this BLU

1. Follow the [Learning Unit Workflow](https://github.com/LDSSA/batch5-students#learning-unit-workflow) to setup your environment.
1. Go through the Learning Notebooks (there's two of them).
1. Do the Exercise notebook, and submit it on [the portal](https://portal.lisbondatascience.org), as usual.
1. There's an extra (optional) material!

## "I need help understanding something"

You can and should ask for help, be it about Learning Notebooks, Exercises, or anything else. Please checkout the [How to Ask for Help](https://ldssa.github.io/wiki/Starters%20Academy%20(LDSSA)/How-to-ask-for-and-give-help/), and remember not to share code when asking for help about the exercises!
