    "**Recommender Systems** (RS) are widely used in companies providing a wide range of similar content (e.g. movies/shows on Netflix, songs/podcasts on Spotify, items on Amazon). Since these companies cannot ask all users to rate every single content (Spotify has [+50 million tracks and 232 million active users)](https://newsroom.spotify.com/company-info/), recommender systems enable the companies to suggest new content for both users which already showed their preferences and to new customers they don't know anything about.\n",

    "The recommender system aims to predict the best ranking possible of items for a user. If we are trying to predict a rating, and a higher rating is a better score, why can't we consider this as a classical regression or an ordinal classification \\*[1] problem? The main aspect of recommender systems (when compared to typical classification/regression problems) is that we are solving a high-sparsity problem on our inputs (meaning, there are a lot of zeros!). We normally have a severe imbalance for unlabeled data, so we consider this task as a matrix completion problem.\n",

Typical classifications problems, such as predicting the weather labels (rain vs sunny vs cloudy) do not have an intrinsic order (e.g. \"sunny is lesser than cloudy\").*"
