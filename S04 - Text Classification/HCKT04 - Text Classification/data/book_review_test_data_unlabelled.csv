A2HESNQJZ9OB7H,Jen,"So boring and stupid had a hard time finishing.  The plot was not close to the discrimination.  She was just dumb.  You don't want attention yet all she everything she did screamed look at me.  The car she drove, the way she dressed and the way she acted was not even close to under cover work.You have her acting all tough and then in the end you make so weak.  She trusted him, dumb on her part because he gets her almost killed.  Which would deserve her right because you don't tell people what your doing when your under cover.

A17GOTFSUAWN17,Tyson,"Whenever I met my last two girlfriends in person, they were all about me. But that script seemed to get flipped whenever we would text each other. So, I tried to get help on the Manosphere.When I first discovered the author&#8217;s blog, I found myself getting really annoyed by his womanizing mindset. There was no way that I was going to ever pay money for any of his books. But, then I read one of his blog posts about how he turned on a woman in less than ten minutes by sending her three or four text messages.So, I swallowed my pride and bought this book.Lothario covers more than just how to text girls in this book, but that&#8217;s really all that I was interested in. Given how strongly I despise arrogant womanizers like him, I read that section with trepidation. My first impression was that his approach to texting women seemed almost too simple to work.But, I tried it out anyway because Lothario, although full of himself, seems intelligent enough.I&#8217;m not going to lie - the results have been pretty good. Now, women chase me during texting exchanges just as they do in person.Guys like Lothario often steer men in the wrong direction. But, I would be disingenuous if I said that using his approach to take control of texting interactions with women is not incredibly easy.A decent book by a womanizing d*****bag.","Short book, but good primer on how to text girls","03 15, 2014",4
A2VO8K861AV83R,"Avatheps ""Avatheps""","I read the reviews and decided to take a chance on this collection. It seemed to offer a good story line and strong characters. I read prodigious quantities and this looked to be a collection that would keep me enthralled for quite some time. I found, however, that although it is fairly well written, it just does not offer any meat to sink my teeth into, The entire book, at least the first 37% of it, is written as if for Sunday school class. To make matters worse, it is being read to the class by Mr Rogers. There is no hard language or violence that is to be expected in an apocalyptic story. The characters are constantly being pursued by some very wimpy aliens that never seem to catch them. Our heroes fire a barrage of gunfire at the aliens and the aliens fire their ray guns back, but neither seems to do any damage to the other. It reminded me of The A Team.If you are a YA and enjoy stories of this nature, then this may be for you. If you are a die hard fan of great apocalyptic/dystopian fiction, not so much.",Very disappointing. I could not finish it.,"12 30, 2013",2

A1F7SNVFZL3AAZ,Pete from across the River,"This has many aspects of a fantasy quest story (like Lord of the Rings, or Eragon) but it diverges somewhat from that pattern.Set in a distant future dystopia, a planet has been occupied by humans having apparently escaped from a disintegrating Earth and a race of aliens (who have strong magical capabilities) who are refugees from their own societal dislocations. Early cooperation between disparate refugees (who happen to have very similar physical characteristics) breaks down with one particular Alien playing the role of a god, keeping one segment of the human population under his despotic control. Since a lengthy period of time has apparently passed since the humans arrived, the survivors have lost many of the technologies that modernity allows us to take for granted. The story is a little vague on this point -- but is would seem that several generations have past for the old knowledge to be so deeply forgotten.The unlikely heroine is energized by the death of her best (female) friend at the hands of the ""god."" Based on rumors and hints from other ""good guys"" in the story, she sets out on a quest to free her town from the control of the ""god"" (really and evil alien) who manages it through the use of magical spells, etc.While there are many loose ends and unexplained cultural traditions (e.g. the importance of a year off from normal work at age 23), the story unfolds with some intense action and a lot of explanatory narrative among the various players to describe this fantasy universe. The primary problem in any fantasy story is to give the reader an understanding of how the fantasy universe works. Most fantasies limit the differences from the real universe so that only a few fantasy features need be explained. This particular story has a rather ambitious fantasy universe that needed to be more fully described to be understandable. At times, the author gives after the fact explanations for certain plot elements -- and, as another reviewer mentions, magical solutions tend to come at very convenient points.This book should prove enjoyable to a reader who likes fantasy genre stories. A bit more than average suspension of belief is required to accept some of the plot variations. I was able to complete reading the book in a couple of days and felt satisfied with it when I finished. I've been reading science fiction and fantasy for nearly 60 years -- so I've seen a lot of stories. I awarded three stars because this story is in about the middle of the pack compared with the multitude of other magical fantasy stories I've read.","Engaging, but slightly flawed","04 17, 2013",3
AGGS7PX5D7C4Q,Eileen,"This book tells the story of two seperate small groups who come together at the end of the story. Neither group is well prepared for the collapse. They are city people who don't know how to live off the land. They are also too trusting of others.  They have a very difficult time until they come together with a larger group near the end of the story. I think a lot of people will be like this. I found it difficult to get the characters straight in my head.  Switching back and forth between the two groups was like reading two books at the same time. I think the evil army was somewhat unbelievable.  I don't think so many people would sell their souls for food. However, the book was a very interesting read.",Another good end of the world story.,"10 30, 2012",4

A2EXMLF4RE7GFM,Debra L. Martin,"I'm a fan Ms. Cantwell and absolutely love her Barbara Marr series so I was excited to read this book. What a treat! KEEP ME GHOSTED is a delightful ghost story. Sophie is desperate for a job so when she is hired by Dr. Callahan, an Developmental Optometry & Vision Therapy doctor, she is thrilled. It seemed like a great fit until she finds out that Cal has an unhappy ghost shadowing him. Moonflower has attached herself to the good doctor and doesn't like other women. Ghosts don't bother Sophie because her best friend is Marmaduke Dodsworth, a British ghost who is hilarious. I loved his British sayings. Things seem perfect, that is, until a jealous Moonflower wreaks havoc in the office scaring away the patients.If you love ghost stories, you'll not go wrong with this one. This book is such an entertaining read. The author has a great flair for storytelling, letting the reader understand and feel the character's emotions. I couldn't stop laughing while I read this story. Sophie and Cal were adorable, but for me, it was Marmi who stole the spotlight.  I want more of this British ghost and can't wait to see what adventures await in the next book! If you're looking to escape everything for a bit, rush out and buy this book.

A3FTNNHMUZV61S,Fred,"ULTRA 1000You are absolutely correct. A liberal being an adept of the left ideology is embedded in a liberal cemented dogma. His liberal brain swallow the liberal ideas and propaganda but cannot differentiate the right from the not so right!Nobody is right except them. Liberals condemn Fox but they never watch it! Let's talk about a bunch of morons! Sure Fox is at times a bit biased on the conservatives' side (such as other left stations towards liberalism) but Facts are Facts and they can be easily checked as true: Fox has withstood the test!Liberals cannot tolerate common sense because they are not capable of any. Look at what the Emperor Obama is doing! I have written a list of points taken from a book (I would not waste time for him) regarding his policy, bad, very bad, so bad that Mr Obama is so lucky of all the useful idiots supporting his atrocious policies.This week, the liberal ''Time magazine'' is even writing that the Emperor is ''GAMBLING WITH IRAN''. What these liberals do not realise is that if Iran wants to eliminate Israel, they WILL start with the powerful countries first: In the name of bringing their messiah the Mahdi! Awful but true! An example of what I am saying is the attack on Pearl Harbour initiated by imperial Japan to first smash powerful America before conquering other Asiatic countries.The Israeli prime minister (Forgive me, I am not sure of the spelling of his name) said it itself: Iran can already strike Israel with missiles they already have but they are working on LONG RANGE missiles, you wonder for whom! as for the old Europe Obama so much admires (!) they will have to later bear the consequences of his foreign policies;I have noticed as well how pedantic and moronic some liberals are, they are mastering the english language, so educated ! and some words must be eradicated as they are hurtful to the ears! Such as Islamic terror, rape... !I believe in the freedom of speech and this is the reason why I have listed the political blunders of the adulated Emperor Obama: Two morons have written to me that, by responding to them, I made no case for myself. Who said I wanted to make a case? Who in his right mind could make a case with a liberal?They even said that intelligent authors of substance like Horowitz and Charles Krauthammer were `'fun'' to read! What a ridiculous idea! They obviously did not understand the underlining message and this message was not fun!At least we can say that Krauthammer wrote his own book, Horowitz as well.....We cannot say the same about `'dreams from my father'', claimed by Obama to have written it although bill Ayers has confirmed of being the author! Another lie from The Emperor!And I am still waiting for the 2 liberals to provide a proof that all the factual blunders of Obama policies I listed were wrong: at least a few, I am being generous!....Still waiting !",Liberal cemented dogma,"12 9, 2013",1

AAD9O8O6Z5EQ,SE Stone,"Liz and Johnny thought that they were safe&#8211;for the moment&#8211;from the new strain of the bubonic plague that the government said was confined to the south. But then their son begins to show symptoms of the plague. A call to the government health hotline leads to their home being boarded up and quarantined. Liz is forced to sit by helplessly as her son grows weaker, the other houses on her street are boarded up, and their connection to the outside world is severed. The only option for her family is to cope the best that they can with the epidemic.The premise of this novella really drew me to the story. Locked room type thrillers set the reader on edge before they even start, and the use of the bubonic plague allows for a great bad guy without having to delve too much into the symptoms or results of a new plague. That part of the story, and the stress it puts on the family, is really effective for the number of pages.With stories set in a single location like a house, the world outside it doesn&#8217;t matter as much and therefore doesn&#8217;t need as much detail to describe it. However Plague lacked much description of the setting both inside and out. There wasn&#8217;t much to help me picture the inside of the rooms apart from a few small details like the location of a chair at the window or creaky stairs. Likewise, the tension in the world outside the house is missing. Even when they are initially quarantined, Liz and Johnny have access to the internet. I think the author missed an opportunity to show online news articles or social media posts to fully engulf the reader in the world.I also had a hard time connecting to the characters. Plague opens up with Nathan&#8211;Liz and Johnny&#8217;s son&#8211;showing the first symptoms of the plague. There are no flashbacks that show the uniqueness of their lives or their personalities. Liz is a worried mom and wife. Johnny is a worried father and husband. There isn&#8217;t much more to them than that. While I sympathized with them in their plight, I didn&#8217;t have any emotional ties to them.This is a short novella, about 125 pages, so I think that may have played a role in the characters lacking depth. That also meant there were a few loose ends during the final pages that I think should have been addressed. The whole story felt two-dimensional.This book would be a good read for someone looking for a quick, light read within the thriller genre.Rating: two of five starsPlague by Lisa Hinsley will be published as an eBook by Pocket Star and will be available for download on December 9, 2013.*I received an advanced copy of this book in return for an unbiased review.",Disappointing,"12 9, 2013",2

A2FBA7JEJS529D,Amazon Customer,"First of all I have to give credit where its due the writing was amazing it had me at hello. I fell head over heels in love with the H within the first 3 pages only to fall right out by chapter 2. But than comes to show appearances can be deceiving.So the back the book did warn you of spanking for pleasure &  punishment. Now, I'm not adverse to pleasure spanking as long as both ends enjoy it. Based on previous reviews the H felt remorse at his treatment of the h so I assumed he regretted the punishment spankings however that is not the case he seemed to revel in them & her pain.Here's I what find extremely & I do mean extremely disturbing. The h is 18 yrs old the H is in mid thirties which is fine and the norm for that era. However she being of 18 with 0 zero sexual experience, with the idea that's drilled to us girls head's from the beginning of time that finding true love & getting married is our ultimate goal, puts our h in a very vulnerable position. With this being said I think she was more in love with the idea of being so loved by the H that he's willing to go to extremes to have her. Because of her youth she's easily persuadable to do his bidding & learns to enjoy his sick foreplay. I don't call that love I call that obsession. When you truly love someone you don't want them to hurt or be scared of you. She does both.Insert from the bookKitty's eyes widened and he saw a flash of doubt, as if she thought she might be chastised ( spanked )for her game, until he relieved her her crushing her lips with his own.This is after he was chasing after her  horseback riding.I really hate and think its sickening that we could think this romance. Would you really wish this on your 18 yr daughter, sister?!?!? For her to live with the anxiety & fear not knowing what's going to trigger his next beating?I also think its a hilarious contradiction of the authors attempt  of redeemable qualities in the hero's expressing his supporting ""in theory only because he never really takes action"" the act against animal cruelty.

A2VDS6RU9H3BMG,"Theresa H Brandt ""Theresa H Brandt""","When you dislike all of the characters.  Dera, as expected, is impossibly beautiful but hated by every woman in the novel, save her lady's maid, Anna.  Quint, is impossibly handsome, but so frequently willing to believe ill of Dera it makes you wonder why he keeps coming back.  In fact, most of the men in this novel hate Dera, at one time or another.  So, why is Dera so sought after?  Oh...I forgot...Dera is impossibly beautiful.She's also rather ridiculous in my view.  On three separate occasions she has information, that if shared, could have made a significant difference to Quint, our romantic hero, but for whatever reason, she chooses to remain silent.  She vacillates between being a doormat and being a shrew toward the men in her life.  At one point Anna, says ""I'll never understand your unthinking tongue.""  I'm right there with you, Anna.I should also note that there is one occasion in this book that walks a very fine line between rape and consensual sex.  If that concerns you, be wary.Overall, I found this book to be a mile wide and an inch deep in its attempt to tell the tempestuous love story of Quint and Dera.  Quint is willfully stubborn and Dera is...well, I don't know what Dera is except beautiful.  There is weak characterization and numerous sex scenes that felt superfluous.

A1UCXBL25GONP2,"Alexander L. Marsh ""Hardcore Gamer""","I have been reading with great interest about the new faction coming to Warmachine, the Convergence of Cyriss.  Seeing that this book was subtitled as ""A prelude to Dark Convergence"" I eagerly dropped the cash and downloaded it.About an hour later I regretted that decision.The book is ploddingly paced and written with a nine-year-olds view on what a mercenary unit consists of.  The characters are largely uninteresting and the ending incredibly predictable with and so called ""surprises"" being obvious to anyone who knows anything about Warmachine and unimpressive to anyone who does not.  Honestly, the whole plot summary could have been given in a short story in No Quarter magazine and its brevity would have made it a bit more interesting.If you are really hyped for any mention of the Convergence then borrow, do not buy this book.  If you are only vaguely interested then I'll tell you everything you need to know:SPOILER ALERT:  A rag-tag group of down on their luck Mercs is hired by a mysterious patron called the ""Old Man"" to capture a mysterious new Warjack that was seen in the swamp.  They fight some Cryx in the swamp (since all swamps have Cryx, it's a rule) and the Cryx want the mystery `jack too.  They beat up some Cryx, then beat up the mystery Jack and haul off its' remains.  They are then saved from a Mysterious Warcaster when their Mysterious patron, Nemo, arrives with the cavalry.  Mysterious foreshadowing of a new threat from this Mysterious new faction ensues, Mercs get paid and respected, the end.END SPOILERSSo, in the end this is really just promotional material that you are paying for.  Which would be fine if it were interesting or written well, and sadly it is neither.",A predictable tale to tease a new faction,"04 15, 2013",2

Most of this short episode focuses on surviving the first day of that the outbreak reaches them.What sets this series apart from other zombie apocalypse series is that so far is that it is about individuals raised in the country side, rather than city dwellers.I like the idea behind the bunker, although the bunker was barely mentioned in this segment.The solid action, appealing setting, and characters have me hooked enough to follow this series.I recommend this episode to readers of Zombie Apocalypse serial stories.",Good Start,"09 19, 2013",4

There are no footnotes or citations (witness this assertion made without citation: &#34;It's likely that the Israeli Intelligence Service, as in the case of 9-11 thirty eight years later, at least knew in advance what was planned, but didn't pass on their knowledge...&#34;  The book is filled with grammatical flaws as well; in short it is nothing more than a poorly written, badly researched, factually unsupported piece of trash-talking conspiracy ranting which should never have seen the light of day.",Terrible!

A1QTCOP4K6MQUI,L. Collins,"&#34;Chain of Title&#34; is a darkly steamy, intense and exhilarating read that winds you up with strong dialogue, authentic characters and an emotion/drama rich plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. Robyn Roze crafts a story about a woman's recent separation with her husband that takes a twisting turn of events as she meets a man that sets her and her loved ones on a path filled with violence, sex, emotion, drama, intrigue and secrets that will change them in truly unexpected ways. The drama is rich with tension, suspense and thrilling scenes that keep you locked into the drama from the beginning to the very end.Ms. Roze has a talent for writing that uses vivid imagery and characters that feel real and tangible to create a world where love and family clash with lust and possession in dangerous ways. It's well-written with a sharp tone that keeps the pace fast and clean, never faltering in its stride to tell the complicated story of Shayna Chastain.Overall, this was an engaging read that certainly impressed from the very first page.

A23N9FNOR21OTV,M. Babbitt,"I just finished reading the Kindle version of this great book and I didn't want to rehash the many positive points others have expressed so well in their reviews here but I do want to emphasize some general points about the book that impressed me so as to get people with any interest in the debate motivated to purchase it. So here's my list:* It is a very good read with great educational value; it's one of those page turners where I felt excited to read further because of its many references (and quotes) to respected luminaries in Christian thought, effectively using their writings as rebuttals to Pastor MacArthur's attacks. Yet, I didn't want to just finish it to get it done; instead, I read it slowly and carefully so as to savor the great lessons provided and the spirit of the book.* It has both fine history lessons and New Testament exegesis.* I enjoyed how Dr. Brown wisely and maturely shows that people can emphasize different aspects of the Gospel message according to their natures (either to the intellectual pole or to the emotional pole of human experience) and how both sides need each other for edification and correction.* I learned a deal from the good, readable, concise overview of the debate between cessationists and continuationists (of which I am in agreement).* Perhaps the most important aspect of the book is the good will Dr. Brown exemplifies as he firmly and responsibly rebuts the sweeping overgeneralizations that Pastor MacArthur's camp has sadly been pushing. Dr. Brown shows how to argue with firmness in one's position and yet not to fall into demonization of the other side. He is both gracious and respectful - and appreciative - to those who have just accused his dear Charismatic tradition of not only being a false one but of also committing great evil. That's quite an outrageous attack to have to respond to but Dr. Brown shows how a Christian deals with such attacks:  He doesn't ignore them but responds with love and charity and yet stands absolutely firm to his principles and convictions.In closing, I don't think Pastor MacArthur (and a number of his supporters) have done the cessationist side any favors with their mean-spirited, uncharitable attacks (in the name of Christian Truth!).  And if I had to choose which side I would lean towards just by their expressed behaviors and attitudes, the Charismatic side would be the hands down winner in terms of showing how Christians should approach a controversial problem, issue, or area of disagreement.",A charitable yet firm response to Dr. MacArthur's attacks on all Charismatics,"12 29, 2013",5

Haha I didn't come up with much the second time because it's just too good to give away.  I really think everyone will want to read it for themselves.NR has a real way with words, the way she writes sucks you in. At least it does me and most everyone of my reading friends. I love a lot of books, I love a lot of authors, but not many grab me from the start, every single time! Not many make small bit characters so good you adore them as much as the main ones. There are two of those in this book. Jennifer, Thomas' long time receptionist. She's just as you would hope, loyal, greatly efficient and all knowing.And Lionel, the door man. Again loyal and greatly efficient in his job. He doesn't really do much, but the banter that goes on between Thomas and Cooper over Lionel, is priceless. It made me laugh out loud each time. The whole book made me smile hugely from beginning to end. It's fun, light, and a great read.I asked myself what was so special about this book, it's easy... Cooper Jones. He's everything the 'blurb' says and so much more. In the words of Thomas Elkin himself, he's ""Mesmerising. Confounding. Amusing. ""Hungry, cute."" ""Impatient, talented, conceited, smug.""""Smartass, juvenile, petulant, belligerent... Cute little shit"" I would add adorable, sexy, confident and just what Tom needs. Surprising me a little because I'm usually all for the older, more mature one but Cooper is just irresistible.

It was one of my favourite reads of the New Year and I gave it 5 stars, noting I was keen to see her future releases.Well, now I've read her follow-up novel, I'm a bit mystified. These books seem to have been written by two different people. The first book is sweet, sexy and fantastically witty. It has a few irritations in the plot, but it was a really entertaining, well-written read.By contrast, ""Slow Burn"" has so many things wrong with it: the sheer number of typos makes it a disjointed read (where was the editor?); the plot has so little credibility it reads like a primary school girl's fantasy; the hero(es) are hot, but the heroine is beyond irritating; the plot device of absent parents is overused beyond belief; the intimate scenes aren't particularly intimate...I could go on and on. I'm so disappointed. I'm really not sure what went on here. It almost seems like, in a desperate bid to get something else out into the market, the author has gone back and tried to rework a story she wrote many years ago, when she was probably still maturing as a writer.I haven't completely given up on this author, but I really hope she takes time to regroup and try to deliver a novel in the same league as her debut, because ""Slow Burn"" is nowhere near it :(",Will the real Nicole Christie please stand up?,"09 26, 2013",2
A1XDDR19L6EIBE,D. Knicely,"I don't know what goes through the minds of some of these people who support Amanda Knox. Desperation is the first thought when reading a factually incorrect book about an important murder case.Ron Hendry and others that write these pro innocence books were not the field investigators that reviewed the scene. Knowing the actual evidence, when you read their books the inconsistencies jump out at you. This book is farcical, factually incorrect and a huge slap in the face of the people that investigated Meredith Kercher's murder in real time, at the scene itself.I have read the court transcripts for Amanda Knox, Raffaelle Sollecito and Rudy Guede. Multiple attackers have been proven and if anyone reads the autopsy of Meredith, it is not only easy to see multiple attackers, it is blatantly obvious.  In fact, even the Defense accepts there were multiple attackers as they tried to introduce new prison witnesses at the first appeal to point the finger at different attackers.  Additionally, there is evidence Meredith's body was moved long after Rudy Guede left the scene and before she was officially found.Amanda and Raffaelle should have never been freed. There are several reasons the Hellman appeal was severely flawed. There are multiple evidence points placing them both at the scene, as if their many lies were not enough. The murder scene is not just the bedroom, it is the cottage itself and easily seen why they were found guilty.Knox lies to this day. Her bathmat scooting story has a recent new twist from her official court testimony, as one example.  These people were rightfully found guilty again in this last appeal. The evidence phase is over, and once the ISC confirms the original convictions Raffaelle will be in prison and Amanda will be extradited. The.

He says over and over again that he can't write certain details because he can't remember or that the details are fuzzy.

Surprisingly Lark agrees to the arrangement and in five days is convinced that they are truly meant to be together.I enjoyed this story. I thought the writing was good. I did think that she forgave him too quickly, but I'm willing to go with that. That's minor. it helps move the story along. There also seems to be the habit with most authors to portray sexual inequality between men and women. For example, during the four years they were apart, he's dated and slept with several women when supposedly he's been in love with her.  But she's only slept with one man, someone who took her virginity, because she's still in love with him.  This is just a minor annoyance of mine.In the second half of the book, after the two lovers declare once again that they'll be together forever, Lark's sister exposes a &#34;secret&#34; that Mason had done four years ago. And without listening to Mason's reasons, Lark breaks up with him convincing herself that he really is untrustworthy! What?? Wow! I thought this was a weak plot point to separate the lovers. There was no cheating involved, no one got pregnant, no one robbed a bank. The &#34;secret&#34; didn't seem like a big deal to me. It takes her two months to come to her senses  and then the story ends abruptly.I've read other reviewers took offense to the sex scene, but truthfully, I thought it was well written. It wasn't too graphic like you would find in a New Adult or Erotica book. And it doesn't happen until 58% into the story. I thought it was tastefully done.","A short, quick read","04 15, 2014",3

AQB6IA9RH7KGU,C. Remes,"""Book"" 5 is my least favorite of the series. Let me enumerate the reasons why.***SPOILER WARNING**** It didn't feel like the story had a beginning, middle and an end. We got a few more adventures with Zed & Murphy but I had no real sense for where this was going. This book was just another ""episode"" in the overall Slow Burn series. I know there is a larger overall story arc here somewhere but I didn't feel this advanced us much.* The Nico sub-plot was obvious from the first moment. When first reading that chapter, I started highlighting all of the *obvious* clues that he killed and ate Mr. Mays.  Dragging that out for another half of the book felt condescending to the readers. Also, turning him into a pedophile was pretty surprising. I can see from the previous book how it might fit, but then adding in his new stuttering speech and this Nico was a completely different Nico from the earlier books. Yes, his temperature went up but I still didn't buy it.* It felt like such a cheat that Mandi & Amy got killed on the boat when it went ashore. They had half a dozen boats tied up to it that they could have used to make their escape just like the others escaped. It didn't make sense that they were left behind and killed. IMO, It only happened so that Murphy could be focused on helping Zed hunt down Smart Ones in the next book.* The Smart Ones hunt should have started in this book. It's been clear for the last two that they should be targeted. Delaying the hunt this long just feels like padding it out.* I read this book in about 6 hours. Paying $3 per novella is getting a bit rich (this was *not* a full length novel). I see this trend of soaking readers with lots of short entries in never-ending series by a lot of the authors who specialize in post-apocalyptic stories and I don't like it.What I liked:* I liked the little bit of Steph & Dalhover. They are good characters but unfortunately they didn't get much to do this go around.* Making the Whites lose the higher frequency band of their hearing is a neat way to allow for suppressed weapons. The explanation was neat and tidy.* I'm glad that some Whites are *not afraid* of the water. The two who were fishing give me hope that water won't be a stand-in for kryptonite going forward.* Zed's deteriorating cognitive ability, poor marksmanship and rising temp add a sense of urgency that the story has been lacking. (Yes, I know Steph said his temp isn't rising but I believe she is lying.) We need to be reminded that Zed is a ticking time bomb (same with Murphy). We need him to go out hunting Smart Ones with a final battle against Mark just as Zed's temperature skyrockets and he completely turns.",A filler book in the series,"07 16, 2014",3

A3A7FF87LEVCQ1,morehumanthanhuman,"This is one of the most utterly masochistic books I've ever read.  Forget consensual power exchange, I don't know if the author is even familiar with the term (I know for sure that the two main characters aren't).  There is nothing wrong with reading a book where characters make mistakes or are unpleasant people, but the female main doesn't possess a bit of self-awareness and the male main is cryptic to an extreme.  I will be discussing some specifics of the plot below.Lorraine is a young woman who interviews for a job as a personal assistant.  Stephen Browman (get used to reading the name like that, for the majority of the book everyone refers to him by his full name) is a hot young billionaire with intimacy/control issues (the only type of billionaire in fictionland).  He decided to fill the empty spot on his slave roster by holding interviews for a personal assistant job that is fictional -- the only job requirement is to be &#34;his property.&#34;  This seems like an extremely inefficient way to fill the position -- even after he eliminated all the people who didn't meet his personal preferences (wrong gender, wrong age, not attractive to him, etc), many women would be uninterested in a job/relationship that would only meet the needs of a sexual minority.Well, whatever, right?  Anyway, Lorraine does well on the interview and is immediately offered a job.  Stephen Browman asks her to sign a contract which she, like any adult, signs without even skimming it.  Strangely, she never goes back to read it, even when subsequent events indicate that being Stephen Browman's personal assistant is unlike any job found outside of the recent flood of &#34;Fifty Shades&#34; tribute erotica.  I don't know . . . once I realized I had agreed to be a billionaire's sex puppet instead of the quotidian personal assistant job I thought I was accepting, I'd be interested in knowing the exact details of what he expected from me and what obligations the contact held me to (or what he was obligated to provide to me).  But Lorraine is just a dandelion seed floating on the wind.  She's gormless and formless, the literary equivalent of a plastic bag waiting for a breeze to pick it up.Stephen Browman goes beyond physical sadism, he's a practitioner of emotional sadism.  He delights in leaving Lorraine in doubt about what is happening, often refuses to speak to her when they are alone, never consults her about any of her needs, blatantly carries on relationships with other women (without discussing this with her), and deliberately causes the end of her marriage.Oh yeah, did I mention that Lorraine is married?  If authors didn't write about adultery, we'd certainly be deprived of some of our greatest works of literature.  I have no expectation that characters in books make good decisions or be decent people.  Yet Lorraine's actions in relationship to her husband are inexplicable and the author offers no help to the reader who may be confused about what is happening.  She isn't confronted with a moment of weakness -- she makes a deliberate choice to become a rich man's sexual plaything because . . . she's bored?  If she'd been trying to work things out with her husband, tried to talk about needs that weren't being met, things would have made a lot more sense.  But it seems like she just chucks her relationship away and, when her husband refuses to accept that she's rather sleep with Stephen Browman than pay attention to anything he has to offer, she acts like she's the victim.When her husband does leave her, her self-pity boggles the mind.  What did you think would happen, Lorraine?  Women usually don't get to have richly rewarded kinky affairs with cruel billionaires AND stay in their comfortable marriages.  Lorraine's self-delusion is epic and it reads to me as if the author is indulging it, that we're supposed to identify with her sadness and grief over losing her marriage.In the midst of all this, we have some by-the-numbers dom/sub sex scenes and a hideously gothic is-he-a-killer-or-isn't-he subplot featuring Stephen Browman's evil (or is he?) pal, Van der Mere (I think that's his name, I read this book last week and my brain is trying to jettison the details as we speak).I found this book actively offensive -- not to moral standards, but on a literary level.  The author has made no effort to present consistent characters.  It makes the characterization in &#34;Fifty Shades&#34; read like Nabokov.  Enter at your own risk.",What did I read?,"04 7, 2014",1

What reality? There are References to states and familiar things, but also very unfamiliar things (apartheid in America, slave traders in remote mountain areas, etc). Is this the future? No other indication of the time period except cell phones and television. So it feels like modern day-- but then doesn't.

A3TE5OTAQOXS65,"Thomas Baker ""Thomas is the Past-President of...","This is an extraordinary book, exquisite beyond words. It is superbly well-written, following a classic story arc that most writers identify with the shape of a, ""W"". This author has planned and executed a carefully-constructed, flawless book that clearly has everything it is supposed to have and more.We meet our protagonist, Donna, who is the only character who will accompany us through each twist and turn, each ""up and down"", literally and figuratively. She is indeed the key to understanding this exquisite story. Her character is dynamic, changing in response to the circumstances she finds herself in. A word of caution: Be careful with  Donna.With her, a German would say, ""Der Schein Tr&uuml;gt"", appearance deceives. A Frenchman would say simply, ""C'est la Vie"", that's life. That's life indeed, and this book is a celebration of life. Nowhere is reality more real than when it defies the imagination to comprehend it. This book does exactly that. But know that if you find something in this book that seems outside of the boundary of credibility, at the same time, know that everything in this book happens all the time, every day... but to other people. The book is therefore truly grounded in reality.Where do we go from here?The protagonist, Donna answers her own question when she says, (quote) ""I don't think we have much choice...it's that way!""(end of quote) Of course she means there is no turning back, that no matter what happens, you must go on. Yes, at this unexpected turn of events in the book, author Lawrence Grodecki cleverly ""arouses"" the reader's curiosity to find out what we instinctively would answer in the negative. Can Ben have a healthy, fulfilling relationship with the woman (Donna) he is seeing for relationship counseling/therapy, his psychologist, his therapist?As we read further, we are convincingly presented with one deliciously delightful coincidence after another. At one point, this leads to the very realistic proposition of knowing something that Ben does not know about Donna, and knowing something that Donna does not know about Ben.This comes about naturally, through the relationships of both characters to secondary characters in the book. Of course this makes for attentive, engaged reading. I confess that I used the underlining function of my Kindle to capture some of the foreshadowing that was provided by the author. Nothing happens by chance, every ""tidbit"" of information, every incident, every person you meet is there for a purpose. This is why I call this book extraordinary, superb, well-written. The hand of a master craftsman and gifted storyteller is clearly evident.Who should read this book? This book is a delightful read for anyone who likes reading books about the complexity of human relationships, and above all, still believes in the power of love. This book is a masterfully written celebration of life and relationships under extraordinary circumstances. Highly recommended.Reviewed by Thomas Jerome BakerAuthor ofHow to Coach a Debate Team (Volume 1)Disclaimer: I was given a digital copy of this book by the author in exchange for a fair and unbiased review.","Exquisite Beyond Words, or, ""C'est la Vie"": Masterfully Written Celebration of Life","02 11, 2014",5

I found Clarice almost instantly likeable and I really sympathised with her.  The repression she fights against is extreme - sexually suggestive items, such as stockings, are illegal yet she smuggles them in to the Reformatory with her. This is the shorter of the two stories and it's a great introduction to Browne's writing style.'Word Thieves' is the story of Sarah, a disillusioned young woman working on a foreign planet where censorship is a way of life.  Sarah has a great love of language so her anger over rewrites of the likes of Shakespeare is understandable and makes for some fantastically witty dialogue.  I found this the more entertaining of the two, as there is quite a bit of dark humour drawn out of the repressive situations.Both of these stories were real page-turners and my only complaint was that there wasn't more as I really would have liked to keep reading!  Browne has created facinating fully formed worlds with interesting characters I thoroughly enjoyed getting to know.I realised while reading this book that the vast majority of sci-fi books I've read have had male narrators, so Browne's strong female characters made a very refreshing change.

Blue KincaidReview from Jeannie Zelos Book reviews.So, the link tags of Erotica and romance had me interested, and the description sounded fine, so I was pleased to get this book for review. It wasn't what I expected though, there's very little BDSM given that December is a professional Submissive and Harry a Dom, even if he's currently having problems. There are a couple of steamy sex scenes, but its not really what I&#8217;d think of as an erotic novel, more a novel with erotic scenes in it. The romance too didn't really work for me. I liked both characters, but didn't really get a sense of who they were, what they were really like, and missed that beautiful sensuality that comes with a growing romance. Here it was straight in with the sex, and the romance grew from there &#8211; except I just didn't really feel it. There was nothing wrong with the writing, a good premise, and well executed, its just I lacked any real connection to the characters. Maybe that's because its quite a short novel, I don't have price or length info but my kindle tells me there's 2,701 locations, which added to the reading time I&#8217;d guess is around 100 pages or so, not really enough for any in-depth characterisation.

I don't know much about putting a book together; but I would have liked to have seen more illustrations with text under or over the images.  That is a personal preference on my part. There are more than enough illustrations.  Most illustrations have text with them and only a few do not.  It does not take away from the story.I also liked the rhyming at the end of every 2nd and 4th line throughout.  I think a young reader would like this also because it would help with phrasing or timing (in reading the words).  Especially since young children are so expressive - this type of rhyming verse lends itself to that.  An enjoyable book.,Childrens eBooks - Sally's Garden Adventure (Rhyming Children's Picture Book),"04 11, 2013",4

AIH41FDX1K0Z4,Christine,"I wasn't sure what I was going to think about this one, but the plot was interesting and kept my attention.Megan is a veterinarian who is being accused for stealing a show dog by an influential man in her town. She seeks the help of an old love, Adam. Adam does not know that Megan has been keeping the fact that they have a 2 year old son. Once Adam finds out the child, he wants to protect his family, but he is not sure if he can be a father especially with the secret he has been holding.I was a little nervous that we would not find out about the child, Cole, until closer to the end of the book, but that did not happen. As soon as Adam found out about his ""C-Man"" (I loved that nickname that Adam gave his son) the story took off.Megan was a great heroine. She was sweet and understanding, but strong at the same time.  I was upset with the fact that she did not tell Adam about Cole until he was 2 years-old.  I think a man should always know. However, we learn what happened in her life with her father so I kind-of understood her fear.  That whole story line about Megan's father was believable.  Usually when an author tries to write a story to make the readers understand the character's angst, it is not so believable.  This, I was able to understand and see how that could truly make her feel that Adam would  do the same.I thought the scenes between Megan and Adam were enduring and passionate. They were pretty hot. The author did a good job allowing me to experience their passion and love for one another.I liked the suspense part of the story.  I loved that Adam was the protector, but then I was disappointed because he seemed to ""run"" every time anything got hard.  The miscommunication of him ""thinking"" what he thought Megan was thinking or feeling about him got on my nerves in the end.  I want a man to act like a man and not be afraid to confront the issues.Did I skim? NoDid I connect to the characters? Yes. It was easy to.Pace of story: Pretty. I have to be honest I thought it was going to drag, but I liked how the author took us and made the reader understand Megan and Adam's love before Cole was introduced to the story.Positives: It was written well.Negatives: I hated that Adam basically waited until the last minute to tell Megan about why he was having those bad dreams.  It honestly pissed me off.  I liked Adam, but wanted to throw an apple or something at him so he would wake up and see him holding stuff in was only making things worse.Do I recommend? Overall, if you are looking for a simple cute love story with a bit of suspense, I recommend. It was a cute story even though the story got a little too sappy for me towards the end.

A2HZEE4MH3HFOE,Kristin Shreffler,"Need a fun romance to read this summer? Then you need to pick up this book ASAP! Deb Julienne&#8217;s book Sex, Lies and Beauty Aids is full of laughter and romance that I couldn&#8217;t put down. The main female character, Sabrina, is a 24 year old virgin who is put in charge of the new Love and Sex column. Her lack of knowledge and experience with either of those things forces Sabrina to open up to &#8220;Travis&#8221; and she finds herself looking for answers in the most unusual places. I won&#8217;t spoil where she goes or who she meets, but trust me, you will be rolling in your seats. I absolutely love Sabrina. She grows in so many ways throughout this book and you can&#8217;t help but feel her emotions. I cried when she cried, I laughed with her and I got angry when she did. By the end of the book, I wanted to high five her and say &#8220;Atta girl!&#8221; She&#8217;s such a great character.The main male character is Trent and he&#8217;s perceived as the playboy of the family, but in reality he&#8217;s so much more. He&#8217;s loyal to his twin and his family that he will do whatever it takes to protect his brother&#8217;s secret. At the same time, he&#8217;s ridden with guilt about lying to Sabrina when he feels such a strong connection to her. Trent would do anything for her, but how can he get her to see that his feelings are real? Trent has to change all the time since he&#8217;s portraying his twin and I could feel the struggle he went through trying to be less himself and more Travis. I love him. He&#8217;s simply a fantastic male character.Overall the book flows really well. It leaves you guessing what shenanigans will happen next. I had to know what happened next and stayed up late a few nights to finish it. There were some really funny twists that I didn&#8217;t see coming and when they got there, they were done very well.

Things that stopped me from giving it a five star rating.I feel like the connection between H and h could have been stronger.  It lacked chemistry.  Their was no intense build up.  Their was minimal interaction between the two.  I would have loved to have more scenes with them together.  It was like one day he says I like you and want more.

The author didn't give me enough insight to their personalities to see how they could fall in love.  And the errors continued to pull me out of the story to the point that I started skimming and quit reading.  Kennedy is at one point referred to Kenney.  In the first chapter it's stated that Becca doesn't own a car and if she needs to go anywhere she rides the bus or walks.  Then in the second chapter she's driving back home from her appointment with Kennedy and is worried about her car.  Then in another chapter the guys are talking to Becca and for two sentences refer to her as Elena, then it goes back to Becca.  At this point I quit keeping track of the inconsistencies and started skimming.

Wow, first of all, it was so taboo, so wrong, but felt amazingly good to read. I love that the story was told from Dorian's p.o.v. The title, Destructively Alluring was so fitting, because Dorian was so intense. His thoughts of Demitra felt and seem like they were driving him crazy and he's going to self destruct and your counting down the minutes he will explode. I felt like I was reading the diary of a crazed man with a need only Demitra can fill. The intensity oozing from Dorian was unlike any I have read. That, and his physical attraction to her was unbelievable. Demitra held her own, although she was so young. I think being around Dorian brought out her confidence from the shy girl you read about in the first chapter. After a while I forgot how young Demitra was, as she seems mature in certain scenes. However, Dorian seem like he was going through puberty and has discovered girls for the first time. That was cute, funny, intense and sexy all in one while reading.The story starts out showing their physical attraction for each other, and although there wasn't any physical interaction towards the end, it was so, so, so, so worth it, especially how the author chose to layout the story. I kid you not, when Dorian and Demitra finally came together, earth shattering, doesn't even come close to describing what took place between both Dorian and Demitra at Dorian's apartment. What made it even more exciting, you know it's forbidden.Dorian decides to do a favor for a family friend that works within the company. To hire his daughter as an intern. This act was the beginning of the end for Dorian as his every waking thought was about Demirta.CHECKLIST TO READER:Sexy Guy (check)Possessive Guy (check)Crazy Guy (check)Shy to confident female (check)Intense (check)Erotic (check)Sex-citingly Good (check)Amazing chemistry physically and emotionally  (check and check)P.S: Love Dorian's best friend even though he was barely in the book.

Henry and Sydney are best friends without the benefits and you soon get a feel that Henry would like it to be best friends with all the benefits.  Sydney however, is a fairly damaged soul and she has no self confidence and suffers from a mother who has absolutely no love for her.  There is a reason behind this but I do not want to write a spoiler into this so I will leave it out.As the story progresses you see that Sydney has a very large crush on Professor Paul Sparling.  This whole subject of teacher/student romance was an interesting part of the read and I loved it.  Once the teacher starts to show an interest in Sydney, her best friend Henry steps in and declares that he has always wanted Sydney.  The sex between Sydney and Henry is HOT and I really enjoyed this part of the book.  Henry is hot, rich and downright dominant in the bedroom but is caring and sweet also.As you read on the story becomes more and more interesting and the plot thickens with secrets, suspense and a cliff hanger ending.

A1UWDZMWGUBL2U,Jeff Carter,"When Hugh Howey opened up the WOOL Universe for others to explore, surely this was one of the approaches he hoped someday to see. In this antholology of short stories, the earliest explorers of Hugh's world (well, as authors, anyway) have pooled their talents and visions to share their &#34;What if?&#34; perspectives of life in an underground tower.Whenever I finish a book, and especially when I finish a series of books, I always suffer from the post-book blahs. I am sad to leave the characters who have become like friends. I miss being immersed in the world that the author & my imagination have created together. I always want more. And that's exactly what WOOL Gathering provides...more. And more. Before I could even begin to think about missing the World of WOOL, I was pulled back into yet another excellently crafted story.Each story brings new characters, a new Silo, a new time period and a new perspective unique to each writer. The stories are carefully crafted to bring one small slice of Silo existence to life. Each story pulled me in within several paragraphs and allowed me to get lost again in the dystopian future I've grown to love.  I felt as though with every new story, each author opened the door to the Wardrobe and ushered me back in to Hugh Howey's post-apocalyptic Narnia.This is an anthology I will definitely revisit from time to time, if only to step back into the Wardrobe once more. If you haven't figured it out by now, I thoroughly enjoyed WOOL Gathering and definitely recommend it to anyone who's a fan of WOOL.NOTE: I was provided an advance copy of this book in exchange for an honest review, which I have provided here.

Huh?  Wouldn't that mean she was fired because of poor performance or something?  So she's a lawyer but now she's scrambling to hopefully get a part-time job as a bartender?Brandon is the owner of the company Katie works for and sees her for the first time in 7 years in a big company meeting.  He's running the meeting while he's got his hand up her skirt at the table?  Then she goes with him into the bathroom for a quickie during the break?  Of course right after he totally blows her off and makes her feel like crap.  (which she should, in my opinion)  So what doe she do?After she finds out he's engaged, Katie goes out to dinner with Brandon and wears her sexiest dress!  He tells her she's not going to get lucky but she goes with him back to his apartment and what do they do?  Fall into bed!  Of course he abandons her immediately afterward because his son is in the hospital.  (she doesn't ask if the son is okay, is just upset that she was used once again.)Katie knows she needs to keep her job (she's the manager over a bunch of people in the New England region) since her roommate isn't working.  So as soon as she gets back from the disastrous weekend meeting, she decides she's going to take a few days off work.  Doesn't call in to tell them, just stays home and eats ice cream.  After 3 days her company calls to find out where she is.  Professional!!!!So she goes back to work for the last few days and the next week, Brandon shows up and calls her into his office.  Guess what they do?  Start to have sex on his desk but his son interrupts so she scrambles to hide under the desk!  Of course, she feels used and abused but that doesn't stop her.Even though this book was less than 60 pages long I really struggled to finish it because it was so unbelievable and the characters were so idiotic.

I get that the book is less than a dollar but to me, if you're going to put your name on something, it should be pretty darn good.I'm also really sick of all the Hunger Games examples that writers seem to be using lately and she's no exception. Way too many. I'd much rather she use her own work to highlight her techniques and examples. That has more value to me than reading about a character who I haven't read or watched and can't identify with. Nor do I want to.",Just okay,"04 29, 2014",1

I was even more excited when I found out it was going to be released in different parts, one each month. It was great to see him in the Amoveo series, and it's amazing how all of her stories are somehow connected. I really like how this book puts a unique twist on the demons of Hell, or the Brotherhood as it is called. They seem like a pretty cool group of guys, and the interaction between them is really entertaining. Then you have Kai, who also brings some interesting twists to the story with her family history.

I feel when authors try to release books in parts there needs be enough conflict, passion, or intensity between the main characters to have cliff hangers.

As I am reading I am captivated by the characters again and in love all over again. The story flowed so well and it made me laugh, and smile. I started to feel for Ben's sister in this book as we learned more about his family which made me feel like I was apart of their family. The love he had for his mother and the bond he shares with his sister. I was left at the end wanting more as the story stayed with me. The cliffhanger is there but I know that book three is around the corner so I have comfort in knowing it is coming. I will recommend this series to everyone as a great read and a love story you don't want to miss out on.The author's writing grew after book one and she created an amazing book two and I honestly cannot wait until book three, four, etc. She has so much talent that I am honored to be able to enjoy it from her paintings to her words. The love she has for the people around her reflects in her words. I cannot wait to see the great things she has left to share for us in the years to come.POSSIBLE SPOILER:I was a little put out with Tess because she like all women assumed the worst in Ben. We all know we do it but in her case it is understandable but truly I wanted to snatch Ben up for myself and run off telling Tess to kiss it. Lol. I am put out with the best friends and I can do away with them all together to be perfectly honest. I had a few choice words with them while I was reading. Hey, I have Ben's back...what can I say.

A2RQQV2X6Y96Y5,Molly McDevitt,"Ya, that was awful! So I knew I didn't like BDSM books and it was very clear that's what this was going to be...why did I buy it? Because I read the least favorable review and it said 50 Shades was a better book. I could barely make it through the first three chapters of 50 Shades it was so poorly written, so I figured if that was the reviewers baseline, this might be a pretty good book. I had read Aftershocks and I liked the characters, so even though I knew it was moving into BDSM, I figured good story, hot fireman, maybe it will work. Nope!I didn't even feel like these were the same characters from the novella. Big, hot, macho Jamie was the most neurotic Dom there probably ever was...okay I don't know, but jeez, for someone who was sooo into being a Dom he sure freaked over every little thing. Seriously, what guy hasn't accidentally hit a girls gag reflex during a blow job, it happens. It's not like he was holding her head and forcing himself down her throat, but jeezaloo he sure acted like it. Every time his churlish wife seemed slightly upset he was falling all over himself...who was the real Dom in this relationship?Then there is bitchy, complaining, whiny Erica. This girl and I would never be friends. These two were supposed to have been married five years at this point. Granted they got married under the worst circumstances, her getting pregnant, and they didn't really know each other...but five years?! These two walk on egg shells around each other. They have never attempted to have an adult conversation and work anything out.The sex scenes were awful. Yeah, I don't like BDSM, but it wasn't even titillating. A woman is left alone, blindfolded, laying across a coffee table with a butt plug in that gives a nice little vibe zap once in awhile, and I'm not supposed to crack up?!I do appreciate the ending disclaimer by the author...don't try this at home.

As I said before,  all stories were good,  but the one's I mentioned were exceptional. Dead Hunger was #1 for me because it was just awesome and I found myself getting very attached to Flex, Gem, Hemp, Charlie and little Trina.  There's actually a part near the end that made me tear up, now that's good writing!  From the Ashes had me rooting for the good guys, love Harry, Derrick and  Frank!

A14VBFAHGRRPOY,"Harmony ""harmonize""","This was a good book with a slow start.  The main character, Mitch spends the first 20% of the book alone, giving it a castaway sort of feel.  The lack of human interaction in favor of build, build, build gets very tedious.  I just wanted to scream at him to stop wasting time milking and making cheese until he had found a girl to help him.  Also, sometimes it seamed like the author had taken some odd shortcuts.  Mitch needed to be rich.. so he is psychic and won the lottery.  For a brilliant, mechanically inclined man there could have been more logical routes to wealth.  Also, it waited until 80% of the book was done before giving background information on previous occupation and why he was reluctant with women.The world building was great with a bizzare mix of familiar and odd creatures.  Tech was near future for the most part, with the occasional odd far future tossed in (""molecular dissasembler"" among people still using Ford trucks and Ipods?)Overall, once Mitch started to find other people and villages the story starts rolling along better.

For me, i struggled with the ridiculousness of the shark's behaviors.  At least the &#34;Snakes on a Plane&#34; snakes were all hopped up on drugs to explain their super, over the top aggressiveness.  What was the deal with these guys?  I mean, really??  Anyone who has experinced even a few days of a Shark Week, knows they just don't act like that.  It seems the writer took the easy path out in making the sharks mindless eating machines, instead of developing a more plausable danger for the characters to navigate. The collapsing facility, the sabateur, greedy investors, lawyers, ego maniac celebrities...all great stuff...all plausible,  why not develop them more?  The last straw for me, came near the end, when suddenly there was a rampaging school of piranhas. Really??  Fresh water fish...in salt water?  Oh Come on!  This writer has skills!  It is too bad she opted not to use all of them and relied on cheesy, C grade thriller blood and gore.  As much as I LOVE a shark thriller....and i mean LOVE.

A1HJY1QSYAX2F,Jessica,"*This is a review of an erotic short story. I've attempted to be delicate in my explanations, but there are references to sexual acts and quotes from the book. There may also be spoilers.*Editing:There were unfinished sentences and sentences that didn't make sense. For example, when talking to her cat, the character says ""I should have you never had you neutered. It might have done you some good to have gotten your evil little heart broken.""""I should have you never had you neutered"" doesn't make sense. In addition, the phrase ""to have gotten"" is so painful it makes me cringe.There was one misuse of ""your"" and numerous randomly placed periods and commas. Several sequences of dialogue didn't have any quotes. In other spots, there were quotes when no one was talking. Sometimes, character thoughts were in quotes while other times they weren't.The Story:Kelly described her ex as ""a tender and very ardent lover."" In the next sentence, she says that Greg often finished lovemaking without pleasing her. Ardent means enthusiastic and passionate. Tender means gentle, loving, and considerate. How was he ardent and tender if he left her wanting?In a scene with Michael, Kelly ""tilted and rubbed her crotch against"" or does something related to the movement of her crotch. Unless the two characters were sitting opposite of each other, scissoring their inseams together, she wasn't tilting her crotch, she was tilting her pelvis or hips. Even though this was an erotic short story, I'm sure that the author was still attempting to convey that the characters were sexy. Just my opinion, but I find the word ""crotch"" to be crass, disgusting, and not sexy. It really detracted from the feel of the moment.Kelly's ""crotch tilting"" leads to arousal. Descriptions of her arousal are disturbing. At one point, Kelly can ""feel slippery oils dripping,"" she ""spilled more heated oil,"" and started ""gushing sticky white fluids."" ""Oily and white"" is not normal for the fluids of female arousal and probably indicates a problem requiring medical attention.In the final scene, Kelly and Michael have a sexual experience in which he gags her with a tie and smacks her on her rear end a few times. Afterwards, Michael expertly informs Kelly that they just engaged in a BDSM scene and that Kelly submitted to him. He then asks her to join him at a private(BDSM)club.One sex act involving a tie and a few smacks does not constitute a BDSM scene. Secondly, this type of play is not an indication that a woman is suddenly a submissive and ready to accept an invitation to a BDSM club!This first story was an attempt to introduce all characters, give their background stories, and establish that the characters are going to begin a BDSM relationship. In accomplishing all those things in one book, the characters turned out being shallow and the story was rushed and unbelievable.","Terrible editing, odd use of words","07 4, 2013",1

I can't really understand why Jasmine fell for him other than the fact that he was rich and sexy. He didn't exactly earn her affection. Also, his behavior came off stalkerish, not romantic. In addition, he was pretty uncultured for someone who is supposedly super rich and has the best of everything. A grown billionaire who drinks bad coffee, stale bagels, and has no idea what foie gras is? Ok, sure. That said, if you like drama, there's a ton of it.

A14S0R0FNAFQUQ,J.Z. Watkins,"I was very pleasantly surprised by how this story did turn out to be one that left me with a feel good feeling not just at the end, but throughout the book. Surprised, because the author did a fine job with tension. No matter the scale, from finding out if a character's wife had survived to the much larger scale of the upcoming alien invasion. The premise was handled well, and I enjoyed the journey with the characters as they pieced together what happened and then made the decisions of what to do.Another surprise for me had been how I normally think its wasted pages to show me all the preparations the characters go through before the big event, yet in this book, with the kinds of character interactions, budding romances and seeing to various families, it was a delight to read.I also enjoyed the world building, and what I mean is how the characters worked to make a better world even at the twilight of its probable end.My only quibble is a minor one, and its more of an in-story raise of the eyebrow, which is the fate of the invasion leader. It was appropriate, I just found it hard to accept he would be left as he was at the end.And while I mention the action at the end, it had not been an afterthought. It was exciting, well paced, whether it was a rescue or the battles. And the battles were fantastic. It was a nice series of give and take from the two sides, cases of move and counter move that were very satisfying to read.On the overall, I'd say a good story of discovery, improving the world in that leaving it a better place than when the characters first encounter it and exciting battles that were great to cheer for the good guys. Definitely a story I'll go back and re-visit.","A wonderful, feel good story","05 14, 2013",5

AVRN2OVEEGX16,"Bob Milne ""Beauty in Ruins - Speculative and ...","Hell's Door may very well be the best, the darkest, and the most perverse serial killer tale or police procedural that I have read in a very long time. What Sandy DeLuca has crafted here is a short novella that works exceedingly well in both genres, taking the first to extremes, while nicely subverting the second, and tying them both together with a twist that I honestly never saw coming.Let's start with the second of the two - the police procedural. On the surface, this is the most straightforward (almost clich&eacute;d) element of the story. Detectives Lacy Powers and John Demmings are tired, jaded, overworked, and overwhelmed by their dogged pursuit of one of the worst serial killers in history. There's the obligatory will-they-won't-they sexual tension between them, with John coming off a failed marriage, and Lacy seemingly married to her job. There's also standard narrative isolation that suggests, no matter how big the case, they're really the only cops in town on the job.Behind all that, however, there's a whole other layer that DeLuca has deftly subverted. She takes the clich&eacute; of the maverick cops who know better than everyone else, who don't need to inconvenience themselves with evidence to solve a case, and almost gleefully demonstrates how wrong they are. We know from the start that they're harassing the wrong suspect, and we're increasingly aware of the fact that more innocent women are dying because of their shared obsession. She also strips both characters to the bone, revealing them to be something other than we'd expect, particularly in the way Lacy presented seems to enjoys the inappropriate attention of their suspect, the devil-worshiping dominatrix, Ramsay Wolfe.Now, as for the second of the two - the serial killer tale - DeLuca pushes that to the limits and rides the razor's edge of almost-too-extreme. She puts us right inside the mind of her killer, exposing us to thoughts, feeling, fears, and fantasies that are clearly the product of a deeply disturbed mind. Whether it's rape with a broken chair leg, removing a victim's skin, or cutting off heads with a knife, she doesn't hesitate to describe the ugliest details, but she's careful not to sadistically glorify the acts. It's very clear what's being done to the women of Providence, but the focus is clearly on the killer's justification for suffering, not on the suffering itself.As for the serial killer in question, to say too much would be to spoil the slow reveal of the story, as well as the final twist. There is absolutely a little Buffalo Bill and Norman Bates in our killer, but not necessarily in the ways you would expect. We get glimpses of history, of past events, that help to illuminate the killer's motives and methods, but DeLuca wisely steers clear of revealing too much, or of trying to transform her monster into a sympathetic victim. One thing I will say, however, is that no matter how creepy or unsettling you find the killer to be while reading, nothing can compare to what you'll think after the final twist.It takes a brave - or possibly troubled - reader to step confidently through Hell's Door, but you won't be disappointed by what you find on the other side. This was a stellar tale, entirely suitable to being read in a single sitting, but I suggest breaking it up over a couple of days, just to give your mind time to process what's going on. Trust me, it's worth it.",A short novella that works exceedingly well as both horror and police procedural,"10 8, 2013",4

I am not into things like this, language and insulting words. Maybe a character speaks like this and it is not my cup of tea, I get how characters have to take on a persona. There was one in jail, and I get where you are a person of color and maybe use terms like those stated in the book loosely, this is just disgusting.

A39529JJJEEDP5,Whistlers Mom,"This one owes so much to Arthur Conan-Doyle I was expecting Holmes and Watson to show up any minute.  The setting is an ancient castle in Scotland so sturdy that gunshots can't be heard in the next room. It's the home of an Earl who's a mover-and-shaker in the British government and the frequent host of high-level secret meetings.  So where better for the Foreign Secretary (and his beautiful, nervous wife) and the American ambassador (and his glamorous, blonde wife) and a high-ranking civil servant known to be in ""intelligence"" (and who's intelligent enough to leave HIS wife at home) to meet with a mysterious scientist who is bringing his SECRET PLANS to show them?It's 1928 and this scientist has solved the puzzle of how to make atoms react and create a super weapon.  Obviously, the possession of this super bomb will completely eliminate future wars and save both the British and U.S. governments lots of money because they will no longer need to maintain armies.  [That worked out well, didn't it?]To disguise the purpose of the meeting (did these men EVER go to their offices?) a large house party is gathered.  There's a madcap heiress (obligatory in 1920's novels) and a wide-awake, slangy reporter and a scatty old-maid governess-turned-companion to provide comic relief.  It's Hogmanay (Scotland's New Year) so there's a huge feast and a dance for the villagers and the two young sons are home from their boarding schools to complicate matters. THEN a blizzard cuts them off and knocks out the telephone service!This is my second Clara Benson and I'm getting quite fond of her.  She isn't above giving a whopper of a clue in the middle of the book and she has a nice way with red herrings.  Angela Marchmont is a stunner of an amateur detective.  She's intelligent, witty, and kindhearted like Gladys Mitchell's Mrs. Bradley and she treats men with outward deference and inward  condescension like Christie's Miss Marple.  She's still mysterious, although we do learn that she has a brother, served in British Intelligence in WWI, and that she has had at least one husband.  She's also wealthy enough to afford a personal maid, a Bentley and a driver, a must for crime-solving among the aristocracy.I'm STILL trying to make up my mind about the odd story put forth to explain the sudden appearance of five mysteries written in the 1920's and not published until now.  Would this very traditional Earl and Countess really have sent their daughters to boarding school because their governess couldn't control them?  And would even the feminist Angela have been enthusiastic about Lady Clemmie going to university at a time when educated women were called ""BlueStockings"" and roundly denounced? As for the idea that the Countess was reconciled to her daughter being educated as long as she became a nurse, it's preposterous. Nurses in that era were very much looked down on and considered little better than prostitutes by many.On the other hand, the long-winded (skip over it!) explanation of the danger posed by communist Russia really does sound authentic to the period.  The murders of the Russian royal family (both Czar and Czarina cousins to the King of England) weighed heavily on the English aristocracy and outshone their fears of German rearmament.  Even a dopey Limousine-Leftist like St. John can't be safely ignored.So I'm still on the fence, but I'm quite  happy to read the other three books in this very entertaining series before I make my final pronouncement.  And if Clara's family finds any more gems in the attic, I'll read those, too.  Maybe they could search Jane Austin's last home and see what they turn up.

A1UFU1Q1KSSWIY,The Kindle Book Review,"A Young Adult book set in 2050 where virtual reality games have developed to the point where the boundaries between reality and virtual reality are blurred. I liked the idea, and the slow build-up in parts 1 and 2 allowed me to follow what was going on. The needs of the two main characters, both young boys, were clearly defined, and I liked the way both characters were developed. The third main character, a feisty young girl, added spice to the melange. By the middle of part 3 the plot and I parted company. As the characters struggled to cling to reality, so did I. My confusion mounted, and the long, drawn-out climax, that lasted throughout the last quarter of the book, left me cold. Lacking adequate explanation, the technical complications that produced ever higher levels of tension were unconvincing. The result was tedium.

She is the reason I kept reading this trilogy &#8211; well I liked the story too.  I love how spunky, tough, and independent Chalice is.  I like reading novels with strong female characters and yet Melissa keeps her story believable because Chalice isn&#8217;t invincible despite her special powers.  Chalice is eighteen in The Return and she definitely hums to the beat of her own drum and refuses to be told what to do.  She&#8217;s a warrior and yet has a soft side. Her love Jeremiah I&#8217;m sure spends a lot of time pulling his hair out while trying to deal with her stubbornness.  Their love story has built from the first novel and is a sweet and pure love.The Return wraps up nicely. In fact both Chalice and Jeremiah come from two different cultures and are not able to marry so it was interesting to see how the author works her way around this.  There are also twists and turns I just wasn&#8217;t expecting and at one point in time I thought something was going to happen that I was most definitely not going to like but thankfully it didn&#8217;t.  I enjoyed this trilogy and my only complaint is that I&#8217;m sad the journey is over.",Perfect Ending to a Great series...,"10 23, 2013",4

A3DRS3VG5RG9ZT,"Bookish Girl ""For the love of books""","I received a copy as part of a giveaway-for-review program.This review first appeared on Extaordinaryreads.com'The Romantic' literally blew me away with its outstanding prose, its almost sly humor and its unusual storyline. This wicked tale has it all--the brilliance of 'Pulp Fiction, the suspense of 'The Deer Hunter', and the tastefully twisted eloquence of 'The Magus'(John Fowles). This is no ordinary writing, however, in its vaulted superiority I hope it is understood as this is a visionary imagination. I loved the minimalist, tight character presentation, the exquisite scene setting including perfect detailing--usually achieved using ten or less words, as well as the charming love story at the heart of this novella- A love story that comes full circle through neat and clever use of a blending theme, the nature of which, I haven't seen in anything other than the classics.It is narration of this quality that all reviewers dream of coming across: especially from the unexpected self-published giveaway-for-review shelf.

I didn't really care much for the cover, or the title.....it seems wedding vows were a catch all for sticking through thick and thin of it. I got through this book with very little problem, but it needed some major editing that I hope ironed out before publication. I failed to immerse myself into the tale. Felix and Tasha had zero chemistry, and from where the story started it really had no background on any chemistry between them. One small scene where he proposed, and I wasn't impressed. Conversation was stilted in places and it seemed that everyone of there friends knew something was wrong with Felix, but everyone had somewhere else to be. It might have been more believable if one of his friends had taken more of a stand. Then Caleb joins the story and I'm flabbergasted. Tasha tells him she is married and he still wants to get coffee....uh...creep much. All the texting was weird. Then there was the urban slang use of the word cum..it's come, I don't know why but when writers use that, and it's not smut it drives me crazy.....lol.

A26YAJDK3Z14US,"Oleg Medvedkov ""How to Prevent Unicorns from ...","Do you know how you read a book and don't really want for it to end? Well, I had that feeling while coming to the last pages of ""The Sartious Mage.""Jek Trayden is a titular Sartious Mage. Despite being only seventeen years of age, he is the most powerful mage in the Kingdom of Goldram among those who can manipulate the Sartious energy. The book starts with Jek performing a kidnapping. He, among some other freelancers, kidnaps Harwin, a young Prince of Zav, a territory that is threatening the war to Goldram. Methods aside, the goal is noble--to avoid the war, and bring the kingdoms to a negotiating table.The only reason Jek gets involved in such an enterprise is because of the reward. King of Goldram, Danveil Takary, promises him a cure for the ""Darkness,"" a condition Jek developed after becoming able to manipulate Sartious energy, and inexplicably related to this magic. Even if the cure takes the magic away from him, he will do anything to get it.Well, the King has different ideas. Jek, backed into the corner, on the advice of Micah Vail, the King's adviser, goes from one royal kidnapping right into the other. While escaping from the castle, Jek kidnaps Princess Lisanda Takay. On her wedding day, of all times.This is not a stereotypical ""a guy steals a princess"" story. Jek, by everyone's account, and as we can see from reading the book, is actually a very nice young man with a soft heart. The spoiled, demanding princess turns out to be a pretty reasonable and bright young woman, who is strong enough to keep the promises she makes. The circumstances in which the two find themselves, are not exactly conductive to build some sort of connection between them. But the adventures await and who knows what will happen...This is the second book I've read by B.T. Narro, the first being (The Rhythm of Rivalry.) ""The Sartious Mage"" is a marked departure in style from the first novel. This one is written in a first person POV, with Jek being the viewpoint character, while ""Bastial Energy"" had multiple characters and multiple points of view. The first person approach is more intimate for developing the main character but is more challenging for fleshing out relationships and advancing the story in general. However, and I think that most people who read this book will agree, the character development and the gradual building of relationships between the personages is this author's strong point. The storyline builds up gradually in intensity, without hanging in the middle, even when the only people on the scene are Jek and Lisanda. Secondary characters are well fleshed out and add to the ambiance and plot development, with Exo and Micah Vail standing out when they make an appearance.In conclusion: I am experiencing slight withdrawals after finishing this book; but I'll have to wait for the next installment to be published. Well, darn it. Give yourself a chance to get into reading ""The Sartious Mage,"" you won't be disappointed.

ANB727EBM4LRS,30 Book A Month Reader,"Faith and Jake are about to get married.  In order to celebrate, they have invited all their friends to their mansion for a house party leading up to the wedding.  Most of Faith and Jake's friends are members of the supernatural community - vampires, werewolves, fae, etc.  Even Fay, Faith's best friend, is a member of this supernatural congregation only she doesn't know it.  In fact, she perceives the world as a human and has no knowledge that the supernatural exists, or that she is actually a fae herself.  Everyone else knows it, but they are forbidden to tell her, because  Fay must come into her powers on her own without interference.  From the moment Fay arrives, she is attracted to Adam (an Alpha werewolf).  Adam quickly realizes she is his mate, but he feels powerless because of Fay's ignorance of the supernatural world, and doesn't know how to tell her about his world without revealing her own heritage.I have read few books in my lifetime that are as dreadful as this one.  Usually in a story there are bright spots, whether it be plot, characters, editing, etc.  Nothing about this book was worthwhile.  The plot was very thin, and very predictable.  The reason that Fay couldn't be told her heritage was just a lame plot device manufactured to create a conflict where none should exist.  The characters were very unlikeable, and in many respects acted silly.  Faith was a ninny who constantly was grabbing Fay and dragging her from conversations, jerking her by the elbow and scurrying her from the room.  If I was Fay, I am sitting Faith down and asking her just what the heck was wrong with her.  Another female character, Hope, was mean and petty.  I think the author intended her to be witty and sharp, but it didn't hit the mark.  All of the other men in the story were either stupid, smug or both.  Adam was the only halfway decent character in the story.  The editing was so bad that I found it hard to take the story seriously.  The story was filled with glaring spelling errors, ex., whinging instead of whining; their instead of there, etc.  Punctuation was thrown to the wayside in favor of dashes, lots and lots of dashes.  Dashes took the place of commas, new sentences, new paragraphs, changes in character POV, etc.  Dashes were used for EVERYTHING.  At the beginning of the book, I had a hard time following each character and who said what because of the sentence fragments and dashes.I realize that someone out there wrote this story.  They are trying, but if they can't have any more respect for their own writing than this, how am I suppose to respect it?  Needless to say I won't buy anymore of M. L.

A3GFNSQEFYL0AB,"Raelee May Carpenter ""Infinity's child""","If this book had been marketed as a memoir, I&#8217;d have loved it. But as a novel&#8230; it fell seriously short.The stream of consciousness style of writing robbed the punch from the book&#8217;s most dramatic events and made the narrator seem incredibly self-focused. The reader likewise is pilfered a full sense of sympathy for the narrator and his daughter by the writer&#8217;s failure to mention her even once before her death. Also, the reader&#8217;s tendency will be to grow impatient with the narrator&#8217;s years of constant waffling over his career options while almost oblivious to his family&#8217;s falling apart around him, as well as his long treatises about the shortcomings of others while giving little airtime to his own.In a memoir, these things would make sense. As a &#8220;real&#8221; person, the narrator is a sympathetic character, who like a lot of us, tries to &#8220;leave his past behind&#8221; until it catches up with him in an importune way, is naturally apprehensive about the balance between passion and fiscal responsibility, and has a tendency to see the best in himself by focusing on the worst in others. As the hero of a novel, however, he&#8217;s an utterly static character, as well as emotionally repressed, shamefully weak, and incredibly selfish. Decidedly un-heroic.I&#8217;m NOT saying don&#8217;t read this book, but you&#8217;ll enjoy it a lot more if you know what to expect. As a memoir, this is one of the most interesting you ever will read. But novel readers are conditioned to expect a more complete sense of dramatic device.One other note: the book blurb gives away WAY too much; don&#8217;t read it if you don&#8217;t like spoilers.

She shares with us the things that make her feel fabulous - playing outside, riding her bike, hopping like a frog, helping her mother bake cakes, reading books, making snow women in her backyard, joining her family in a trip to the park, to the beach, and even looking at the stars in the night sky. Emma love to dress up for school and she especially love family picnics. Or as Emma phrases it, `These things I do, I think they are fun. They make me feel I am a special one.'

A28OB90E503S5O,Jason T. Graves,"The storyline of Dark Child is very linear and reads in places like an outline barely padded with some word flesh. Event A must occur such that Event B can occur such that Event C can occur... it was tiresome to read at times. Some digressions would have been welcome, particularly for character development and specifically because the heroine, Kat, is the only rounded out character in the entire 20,000 words.The writing is relatively pedestrian and non-evocative. Ms. West tells us the story instead of showing us the story. There is some potential to this tale, but at US$7.00 for the remaining four parts, I won't be coming along for the ride. I'm unclear as to why the publisher thought that breaking this novel up into five parts was a good idea.Finally, I cannot understand why an Australian writer would choose to set her book in the United States and not make every effort to remove the Britishisms from the story--particularly when backed by a large publisher. Do the publishers not care about issues such as these?

When first love happens, how does one distinguish between  true love and lust?  Maggie travels to North Carolina to help a distressed baseball player and finds herself lost in a soul searching struggle with his agent.....is she sexually attracted?  Has the agent, Jordan, displaced feelings of love for her as a therapist?  Has she made a terrible mistake by giving in to her own sexual desires?The first chapter had me laughing out loud.  Maggie and Jordan were at odds and Maggie's sarcasm and sharp wit were evident.  The remaining chapters centered around helping Carlos, the ball player, come to grips with his own reality and the sexual tension between free spirited Maggie and  not sexually active, Jordan.  It wasn't my favorite love story of all time--Maggie seemed to over think things too much.

A3JBLE5QZI5JI1,Gonzalez,"""First&#894; for some people no amount of evidence, nomatter  how  logically  sound  will  convince  them  of something  they  do  not  want  to be  convinced of.""-A quote from the authorBefore I begin, let's all remember that we will tend to agree with people who think like us. With that said, please do not just give me a thumbs down because you want this book to be ""good"" and believe me to be a ""illogical atheist."" Here me out as to why I am saying the author of this book is not being rational or transparent.Let us start from the beginning. This book is presented as an analysis of illogical atheist arguments. It is written in a semi-formal style that you find in scholarly journals on library databases such as ebsco. It assumes that the audience is has very little formal training in deductive logic and therefore has detailed historical facts and explanations as to what the author is intending to demonstrate. However, it becomes apparent that the book is not what it appears after a few paragraphs. For example, the quotes, ""After my eyes rolled from the back of my skull, it slowly sunk in why Atkins would propose such a preposterous thing, "" and ""So, the objection that God is improbable because he is complicated and extraordinary is  philosophical garbage which we shall be dealing with when we come to discuss the Dawkinsian fallacy from evolutionism, "" are just some of the things that the author says that are irrelevant and unnecessary for a discussion or analysis of any work. The author also goes on to make an insult about people who are politically liberal as well.Now let's examine the actual support and methodology that the author uses for his argument. Mr. Jinn uses deductive reasoning to present his ""counter argument"" as to why atheism is illogical. Let me use the examples in chapter six. Out of the first four syllogisms that he presents, he only is able to truly dismiss the second premises. He never provides actual reason as to why the other two are wrong. Instead, he goes off into a another story, or a syllogism as he calls it. Effectively, he is guilty of begging the question and also creating a straw man. This is pretty much the way that the entire book is written.So what am I trying to say? The author of this book reveals very little details about his qualifications or background. He does not present evidence as to why a specified argument is illogical, but a way to get around it. If you are truly interested in finding a book on logic or why atheism is illogical, please go read a scholar-review or a journal (they are free). Alternatively, why not invest time in taking a course or reading a book on abstract logic and then finding the flaws in atheism? There may be many things that are wrong with atheism, but this book and its author are not capable of revealing them.",This book is just a rant,"01 11, 2014",2

Then come back and read book two tomorrow.... I say tomorrow because once you start book one you won't put it down until you've finished it and unlike me, you can just buy book two instead of having to endure the wait for it to be released! That being said, it's not often a 2nd book in a series can live up to my expectations, but Ms Zanetti pulled it off with ease! The first book, Against the Wall came out several months ago and was a great book as well, and has character interaction that leads up to this installment. You also get to re-visit with characters from book one, as well as with the characters that will hopefully be the main characters in book three (Hawk, please!)The characters in Under the Covers, sheriff Quinn and his lady love Juliet are a couple of very strong characters. Quinn is the stubborn sheriff that basically defines the phrase &#34;sex on a stick&#34; in my mind! Quinn is a former military man (cowboy, military sheriff? Yeah, what dreams are made of!), which i can personally relate to, being married to a Marine myself. He is strong, and fierce and has an amazing sense of figuring people out. He definitely has his work cut out for himself figuring out the strong willed and defiant Juliet,Rebecca Zanetti writes books that make you feel like you are right there in the story as it is unfolding.Under the Covers is filled with lots of heat, that is well written and from the very beginning. There is plenty of humor, which makes me love the book even more. The story takes place in beautiful Montana and is described in such a way that it makes you want to pack your bags and head off to find your own Montana Cowboy. A lodge cowboy preferably! The character interaction between all the members of the Lodge/Freeze family have me anxiously awaiting book three in this series.... And we can't forget the best friend of the  Family, Hawk!

She has written this book to provide encouragement to other women as they enter menopause so that they can stay healthy and fit as they age.Penelope's journey to managing her menopause started when she enrolled in a weight control and diet system that she saw advertised on television. The system continues to work for her and she is consistently losing weight while managing her menopause symptoms.She discusses her food options and tells us what her daily diet now consists of and it certainly looks very satisfying to me. The list of foods is not restrictive and I think will satisfy most tastes. Even though it is calorie controlled Penelope has found that she rarely feels hungry between meals and is happy eating smaller portions.Now to the exercise. This is managed in a 30 minute session per day that features metabolic training that creates the phenomenon known as continuous burn. The 30-minute program is a real winner because most people can find the necessary half hour, especially when they don't have to go to the gym.The workouts are designed to completely overhaul your entire physique in just 30 minutes a day over a 90 day period.Penelope also covers the topic of stress and the part that it plays in menopause symptoms and goes on to discuss the things that cause her stress and the methods she uses to reduce or eliminate that stress.I think this is a beneficial book for any women entering menopause and looking for ways to manage the symptoms in a natural manner.",A Beneficial Book For Any Women Entering Menopause,"01 9, 2013",5

This page-turner is a drama, a mystery, and a romance all rolled together.  I plan to read more of Camilla's adventures.",Romantic Mystery Drama,"10 6, 2013",5
A2NQGFXTBJHYID,Bookgem,"Breathe Into Me is one of those books that you can&#8217;t really say much without giving anything away, I feel like her story needs to be experienced blindly. When I first read the description of the book, I instantly knew I had to read it, I am a sucker for a book when there is a kid involved and someone doing everything they can to make sure they are taken care of and are given everything they need. Of course by this point my mind runs away and starts guessing at what this book is all about, but I was so very wrong and I couldn&#8217;t be any happier than how things turned out.I was so mad reading this book, just wanted to yell, scream and fight someone. While there is a love story, it was also finding herself, the person she lost along the way and learning how to live with the guilt and shame that eats away at you when you give it the power too. It was truly painstakingly beautiful to read. I do wish it was longer, I do wish I got more in the end but that is me just being selfish.

A365FBX30IFK66,"C. Stone ""Reese""","I read this because the summary sounded interested. Caitlin our heroine has several part time jobs to make ends meet while going to college. She hears a friend mention how much money she makes pole dancing at a local club.  While Caitlin doesnt want to shake her ta-tas, she has to free up time to study and keep her grades from slipping, which means a better paying part time job.Jake knows instantly that the applicant for a new dancer at his club is not gonna work out.Still something about her appeals to him.When Caitlin's car breaks down, it gives him a chance to find out more about the young woman that he finds attractive. Everything he hears resonates with him and he wants to get closer to her.Overall this was ok, there were some typos, grammar issues etc. Jake's speech was a la some of the heroes in Kristen Ashley's romance but the story didnt necessarily make me think of a KA book.  I liked some of the nice things that Jake did for Caitlin and I can see why she would fall for him.  The secondary characters weren't necessarily fleshed out and I felt that Jake's best friend and partner Dale,had odd behavior that was never quite explained. The background story of the serial killer was interesting and done well.There was room for me details and information but I would still try this authors other work",just ok,"01 30, 2013",3

Presentation is very fast paced and engaging but has many situations that occur strictly by luck, both fortunate and unfortunate. Story starts out on earth and quickly evolves through a series of events into an amazing story line. The author does a good job showing the development of relationships and characters, some use of high technology occurs but it is relegated to magic black box without much explanation other then it simple works this way.The author does an amazing job to highlight many daily cultural assumptions and in a short time raise the question of why they are that way. The handling of each situation is done in a light but thought provoking way, that does not detract from the story line but gives added depth if the reader wants to ponder them.Overall the story is light and entertaining that is not over burdened by technical details but shows excellent character development and leaves the reader wanting to read more.The story setting created by the author has great potential for many plot lines and side story development. It is hoped that the author writes many more instalments or opens the universe he has created to other authors for them to create stories in.A thoroughly good read.",BATTLE OF THE NEW ORLEANS,"12 17, 2013",4

So many people would fall for these tactics! So many of the situations seem like commonplace moments in a day.  Particularly when answering a phone in a workplace, you are in 'helpful employee' mode and it would be so easy to give out information to someone projecting themselves as a confident, official sort.

In fact, it wasn't sarcasm: it was pages & pages of bad slapstick, insults and snide comments.When I read ""Death by Sarcasm"", it was a delight.  The dialogue was witty, the story well developed and the players descriptive.  The sarcasm left you laughing at the ""bite"" and added to the richness of the book.  With this book, the sarcastic dialogue attacked you immediately in the first pages and you're taken back by the brashness of it.  It just wasn't funny!  Mary is obnoxious, Alice is crude and the overall story is just meaningless.  The book was wrapped-up nice and neat in the end after Mary one-handedly tracked the killers, figured out the situation, rescued the missing woman and was reunited with her lover.  Yeah, right.This is a stupid book to me and I'm sorry I bought it.  It was a fast read because there was nothing substantial in the text.

For starters, it is fairly clear that the author has at best a rudimentary understanding of what BDSM is all about. The scenarios that include elements of BDSM are almost laughable in the simplistic manner they are portrayed.There really is no plot to the story beyond Sammie, the main character, running from one sexual episode to another. She seems to be constantly in heat, which gives the book an adolescent fantasy/wet dream quality.

A2EX1NIVAENBHZ,James Minter,"One thing you can always be assured of when reading a non-fiction `how to...' book for writers written by Joanna is that a) it's based on her personal experience, b) it's written with passion from the heart and c) the information is trustworthy as she knows it. `Public Speaking for Authors, Creatives and Other Introverts' is no different.In the UK we are very bad a public speaking in general. If you look across the pond, our American cousins appear to be better prepared for the task, with speaking to groups being an integral part of their school curriculum. These days many businesses require you to get up on your feet and share with co-workers. Public speaking is becoming an essential skill for anyone wanting career progression not just writers adding another revenue stream to their bow. This book, repurposed, has a much wider audience.Joanna tackles this subject in four parts: the practicalities of speaking; the psychological aspects on you the speaker, of having to stand up in front of a group; the business side of speaking to turn it into a revenue stream; and finally, to underline her assertions / advice/ hints and tips she shares the experiences of three professional speakers. And as an eBook, it comes with extensive additional multi-media content to dip into as and when. The whole book itself is a resource which can be cherry-picked depending on where you are with your speaking career.If I had one criticism to make, it is that Joanna has included too much content! Like most (all) subjects they cross-over into other areas and where to draw the line is sometimes difficult to decide. This is a very inclusive book but it could be streamlined to stay on message. However, don't let this put you off. The extra content is create - if you know Joanna's work already, some of it you will have seen before.In conclusion, this book is like a presentation skills course on steroids; very well worth the money and time to read it. Then of course it's over to you to implement the mass of ideas, tips, advice, insights etc. contained herein. And that's the tricky part: no matter how many books you read on dieting, they won't make you thin.

A1Z4Q8CPZMB22N,"Celeste Whitlow ""Morgaine""","This post-apocalyptic first book of the Arisen series approaches the subject from a military person's point of view. This makes the story it tells fascinating and unique.  It takes the zombie-apocalypse genre to a whole new level.There is plenty of action that keeps the reader turning the pages.  Because of its military approach to the unfolding of the post-apocalyptic setting and story, there is a calm, one-step back feel to how the story unfolds. It is a relief to know the major characters are competent and able to handle the situations as they occur.  So many of the post-apocalyptic literature suffers from the nincompoopery of its characters, such that I often find myself wondering ""how in the world did these people ever make it through a normal day BEFORE the apocalypse,"" which makes it less believable when they magically find new skills to deal with very dire new situations.The characters are well-rounded, interesting, and believable. There are no ""token bad guys"" (bad guys inserted into the storyline just to keep it interesting).I appreciate the book's attention to avoiding lots of editorial problems.  There are, for sure, a few, but they are not distracting from the storyline.Because of the military setting, there are lots of acronyms and military jingoisms.  The first read of the book was a bit trying because of trying to keep the lingo straight.  However, I am reading it the second time with the specific purpose of writing down the (unfamiliar to me) military info about the major characters, acronyms, abbreviations, etc.  I have a great Kindle note app, and I flip back and forth between the book and the note app to record unfamiliar terms and info about the characters.I would encourage potential readers not to be discouraged by the unfamiliar military terms and acronyms. It was more of an issue in the beginning of the book, and the amount of new terms steadily decreased towards the end.  In addition, I routinely set up a notes file for books I read, especially if I think I will re-read the book in the future, and the book is a great read without knowing all the military details.I am looking forward to catching up with the rest of the published series.  This book is certainly worth the price of admission.",Lots of action and a unique approach to post-apocalyptic fiction,"02 3, 2014",4

You don't get pressed into your seat by the momentum of your shuttle craft. It's acceleration AKA &#34;change in momentum&#34; for anyone who has ever bothered with even the most rudimentary physics class.

Review them as a series and not just as one book at a time.And keep an open mind. This Series will change your life if you let it.I was given this book as an ARC for an honest review.I gave this book 4.5 stars.This is the first book that I have read from this Author.This is book one in the Lost & Found Series.This is Becca, Grayson and Ray's story.OK Becca was in a bad marriage and lost her husband in the war. Now all she wants to do is raise her daughter and live her life. She does not trust men at all! She runs her B&B; and is happy with all that she has.That is until she meets her employee's (and second mom's) nephew, Grayson. Grayson is an alpha male if there every was one. Now he has come to visit his Aunt and has fallen, love at first sight! He will stop at nothing to get her, and although Becca fights him at first she gives in. Then Grayson in his alpha ways does something that pushes her into the arms of her best friend Ray who has always been in love with Becca. Now that Becca knows how Ray feels what is she going to do? Is she going to go back to the impossible man Grayson or is she going to give the sweet man that would never do the things that Grayson is doing to her a chance? You will be caught by surprise in this love triangle that will leave your head spinning and wondering which way is up!!OMG! First I will tell you what I didn't like and why I only gave this story a 4.5 (rounded up:)) This book went FAST! I mean I don't think I would have time to like someone let alone love them in the time that Becca and Grayson did. I do believe in love at first sight. But I also believe that everything else happens at a slower pace. I also believe that after all that Becca has been through that she would not put up with all of Grayson's dominating ways! There is no way! I mean some of the things that he dominated were ok, but he did push it way more then he should have. But all of that put aside. I did love this story and was drawn into it from the very beginning. I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next. And the triangle didn't happen just like that, it just kind of happened and I did like that too, it was not like she just decided hey I want to date two men. You will be shocked at all the things that happen in this book. It is not just a love triangle. Becca has to learn to trust and love again. And sometimes that is hard when you have been through so much. Grayson is charming and wonderful and sexy as sin! Get ready for the ride of your life, hold on and don't let go.

A9G85AO0S9UTB,Meghan,"A blood-curdling, edge-of-your-seat tale that has the unique power to make readers ask questions, Liron Fine's `At God's Mercy' is one of those unforgettable books you rarely encounter. In the first few pages alone, the book grabs you and doesn't let go--and from there proceeds to build up a literary ""arpeggio"" that succeeds in pushing our ""thrill"" buttons as well as the deeper, higher ones.Basically, `At God's Mercy' is the story about two twins who, as fate would have it, end up adopted by two different families having two different religions: one Christian, the other Jewish. The separation is brought about by violence and murder of their mother during the tail-end of the Second World War. Many decades later, the twins would meet--and as anyone who wants answers to their gigantic questions--agree despite their differences to embark on a journey that will allow them to touch base with their roots and come full-circle to their dreadful past. Along the way, they discover so much more than they had expected--about their history and about themselves.Let me suffice it to say that `At God's Mercy' is not one of those books that offer cheap thrills. Yes, it is a suspense thriller--but one with enough intellectual and emotional gravitas to make the book a worthwhile, haunting read. Liron is a confident writer at the height of his powers, and this book is a shining testament to that talent. Overall, I highly recommend this to anyone who not only wants to be enthralled and entertained, but also deeply moved as well.

The story is told in first person by Mariah, the protagonist, who works for Sweet Baby Girl escorts. If you're uncomfortable with a great deal of foul language and graphic sex scenes, then you should bypass this book. It's HOT but it's not for the faint of heart. Ms. Roberts doesn't paint a pretty picture of the sex industry but she also doesn't portray Mariah in a bad light. Mariah is a very likeable character who will tickle your funny-bone with her observations of clients (just wait till you read about Henry Walker). Although her life itself is an interesting read, it wouldn't be as exciting without a love triangle... enter Randall and Johnny. For .99 you get a great story about a taboo topic.

A328S9RN3U5M68,Grady Harp,"For those who regularly review books, CDs, DVDs, and other paraphernalia for Amazon.com this little shared book by Rebecca Johnson, one of Amazon's very best reviewers, is a breath of fresh air.  In this book she shares her history of starting to review for Amazon in the early days, the progress she has enjoyed with her reviewing for Amazon, a bit of inside information about the ranking system (the abrupt changes when Amazon dumped helpful votes a few years back and then started new rules and regulations for reviewers, etc), the types of things she enjoys reviewing, her procedure of writing reviews, and the positive and negative comments that are destined to appear on occasion by people who read reviews.What happens in this book is a series of `aHa' moments and a good number of knowing winks for those of us who review daily for Amazon.  It is great to both share and commiserate about the ups and down side of reviewing, how books from authors requesting reviews pile up, the dastardly habit some publishers have of sending out books with heavy ink markings on the books sides of pages as `For Review Purposes ONLY' or the ugly sticky stickers on the front or back cover of books stating the book is not for sale - those little annoyances that make you want to put that book at the bottom of the to-read pile.But she also shares a lot of information for authors and PR publicists and publishers on what works for and against making a positive impression on the reviewer: good lessons in courtesy and polite responses are included.  Then towards book's end Rebecca adds questions various people have posed to her - why her reviews tend to be positive, how she responds to those who email her or place nasty comments in the comment section, what her personal likes and dislikes are, etc.  All of this information is eminently readable and carries that same degree of caring and informed sense of intellectual responsibility that suffuses her reviews.  So from both sides  - from the fellow reviewers and from those who seek reviews - there is a plethora of information and a delightful bit of inside views to the charming Rebecca Johnson...perhaps over a special brand of chocolate!

A19OR3OKLV7JV3,Hope Painter,"The Beginning is an amazing e-short prequel that gives you a look into the story and the beginning of The Bridge. No matter how long a Karen story is it will always tug at my heart and have me looking for so much more when the book is finally released on October 23. Karen is an amazing author that really knows how to listen to Gods amazing words when he places things on her heart, no matter your age or situation you will close one chapter and just feel so blessed. I loved reading these chapters and really feeling the connection early with the characters. This prequel and book are going to be the most amazing book to be released this time of the year. We are getting into the spirit of holidays coming and everyone getting in the spirit and this will teach all of us what love, friendship, and how great when God tells us something to do he knows the plans and how we can impact lives.",Karen Never Disappoints....,"09 18, 2012",5
A23EDU10K0LALL,Stephanie,"Wow, I finished this book and that was my thought. I got to a point where I could not put it down. I needed to know how everything came together and I was not disappointed!This is an intriguing story! We meet Ariel, a young woman who has just been kicked in the gut when she finds her boyfriend having sex with her two best friends. She later finds out she has inherited her great aunt's estate. She picks up and moves to the estate in Missouri, figuring there is nothing left for her after her boyfriend's betrayal. From that point on out, there are a lot of unanswered questions about the legends of the large dead tree on the property.She also meets sexy landscaper Grady when she hires him to remove the dead tree on her property. An attraction between them begins to sizzle.There isn't too much more I can say without giving out any spoilers. I loved that as Ariel reads her aunt's memoirs, we are taken back in time and it is told to us through her great aunt Blythe's eyes. At that point in time, I wasn't sure which story line I loved more.I loved that Ariel is a self-sufficient woman and how she handles Grady at one point in the story for his sketchy behavior had me cheering!The ending blew me away! All the questions are answered and it was quite a shocker. This is a wonderful romance with a heaping of mystery and suspense mixed in for good measure. Great story!! I highly recommend!!","Wonderful, Intriguing Story!","06 7, 2014",5

A146GES6Q3H4MQ,incognito,"Loved this book!Ashleigh was raised to be the heir to her grandfather, and is pretty unconventional. She plays poker, and can cheat like a champ. She's great at chess. She rides her stallion in breaches and races for fun. She wants to learn how to fence, she's smart, funny, and completely beautiful. (She reminds me a lot of one of Judith McNaughts characters...can't remember the name! But I should add that this book packs the emotion of MCNaughts books too).Nicholas is a Duke who doesn't want marriage, hes been burned and distrusts all women. But, He's a gentlemen who adores his grandma, and so doesn't refuse her anything...including allowing Ashleigh to remain a guest.Our H/h meet when she's out riding and they're instantly attracted to each other, and he's sure she's just someone out to ensnare him into the marriage trap, he walks away wanting to find her and propose an illicit affair. Turns out he finds her sooner then he hopes...at dinner that night as his grandmas guest. He realizes she's off limits but to battle the attraction he starts to ignore her, she recognizes it for what it is, and is pretty forward in getting him to acknowledge there's something there. She recognizes herself as being in love with him from the beginning and they have a few stolen moments together where his kisses do nothing but reassure her that she's right, and so she keeps after him. Our hero though is very mistrustful, and there are some purely innocent moments that occur which serve to heighten his distrust. Eventually their relationship comes to a breaking point and in a jealous rage she shouts out that he isn't the only one she's had. At this point she's still innocent of all wrongdoing, and his mistrust blinds him to how great she is. Every time they get close again, something innocent happens to set him off, or he gets to comfortable with her and runs off before he allows himself to depend on her love.The book has a lot of emotion, and I even tear'ed up at the end. You really felt him falling for her, it was totally packed with emotions...often suppressed, but they were there; honestly I think Ashleigh fell blindingly fast, but she held fast to her feelings throughout the book- I think once I just shut my mind off to the fact that this was a 17 year old girl and a 29 year old man, I became ok with her feelings being legit and really enjoyed the story!Awesome book, and highly recommended.

ABE24CQTH0J6U,Julie Solorio,"Review of Far Too Tempting by Lauren Blakely4.5 starsI connected with this book. I lived it and breathed it like it was happening in real time, in real life. I rooted for Jane, wanted to reach in and help her. I lusted after Mathew, wanted to reach in and touch that sexy Brit. Alas, I couldn't touch Mathew and I couldn't help Jane but wouldn't you know that Lauren Blakely wrapped it all up in a nice big bow and made it all right.Jane Black is a rock-star. She was finally made it with her latest album after three that didn't hit that spot for listeners. She is living the dream and has a brand new Grammy to show for it. The only problem is that her success and her fabulous music have come from a place of real pain. The life-changing and soul-crushing kind of pain that leaves a person inherently changed. And Jane is, changed.Matthew is a sexy British music critic with an eye for Jane. He loved her latest album which only served to make him more interested in her. When he sees an opportunity to combine business with pleasure, he takes it. Ever the professional he tries to keep his feelings at bay as he completes his assignment. He can't fight his feelings for her forever and as he tries to break down her walls he lets her in and falls for her at the same time.""How can he kiss me senseless in the elevator and then hold my hand as if he's my guy and he's worried that I won't make my deadline? But he manages both sides- the sexy one and the considerate one- and if he keeps this up, my mind just might turn to mush because I am dangerously close to this being more than just a crazy kind of chemistry, more than a fun bit of flirting. I could see him as the man in my life.""Jane has been lied to, betrayed and had her heart broken. She is now navigating life a survivor of said events. It's extremely hard for Jane to allow her newly patched-back-together heart to risk love again. Will Matthew be the balm she needs to heal her heart for good? Or will his career take center stage subjecting Jane to betrayal once again?""I am shaking right now, deep, searing tears pierce my throat, big splashes of salty water threaten to spill from my eyes because right now, this is all my fears, all my doubts, crashing around me again. This is me believing in something so deeply and then finding out I was tricked.""I loved this story. Jane was a refreshing character. She was real, normal and relatable. Besides being a rock star, she was a proud mom, a friend and family member. I loved how she talked about her son. I loved how she interacted with her family and friends. I just plain liked her.I also loved her process as a songwriter. I know little about music and musicians but I felt this was such a great glimpse into music. I am not a songwriter by any stretch of the imagination but Jane's story had me wanting to scribble song lyrics on scraps of paper and mail them to her. I found myself seeing the music in her life when she couldn't. Then I read a little further. And damn you Lauren Blakely for making me feel musically smart for a minute because it was your fabulous writing all along. You expertly placed these musically inspired scenes and then had her relive them as she wrote her album. It was EPIC! I loved seeing it all come together. I love music and this book will defiantly be getting a playlist. I may even read it again as I listen to my playlist. I would read it again, it was that good.An ARC was kindly provided by the author for an honest review.Review can also be read at readlovelust.com",Far Too Tempting,"10 21, 2013",5

The heroine, Victoria, is a down-to-earth woman who is not easily intimidated. After touring the world as an expert photographer, she's now living with her eight-year old daughter and teaching media at the local art college. Victoria's hobby of rescuing and caring for injured and sick hedgehogs has turned into a mission. The locals call her the Hedgehog Lady. She'd do anything to protect her little patients. But she has to deal with her neighbors. The new owner of Larchfield Hall wants to renovate the manor and erect luxurious homes on the ten acres of gardens. In other words, his bulldozers would kill the hedgehogs.Luckily for Victoria and her prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, Adam Cantrell is a nice guy, and a smart one, who'd find a solution to every problem. Especially when his only son befriends Victoria's daughter, and Adam himself enjoys the young mother's company. A delightful romance.","Between children, hedgehogs, and love","12 11, 2012",5

The title gives you the gist of what kind of exhibitionist/voyeuristic thrills you're in for, but this is a popular suburbanite fantasy scenario done really well. The pace is good and the suspense builds well as the nerves are gradually subdued and the inhibitions cast aside.The six participating characters are suitably hot, but it's their great chemistry that keeps the pages flicking on by as the cards are played and established couples face up to their boundaries before duly crossing them with breathtaking abandon. At the heart of it all is a sweetly resolved conflict between three long-standing friends, where a little misconstrued history brews simmering jealousy, piling on the sexual tension until it breaks in an exhilarating and satisfying crescendo.",Sizzling hot,"04 4, 2013",5

A18DSSY1FGEGAB,Gregory Smith,"I learned a lot about this book, while is true that you can't think you have blue eyes if they are brown, you can train your subconscious to get rid of those negative thoughts that are holding you back. The author goes beyond making statements, she actually proves her points with science. When she wrote that negative thoughts can shrink 20% of your brain, I researched that and saw it was true. I think this is a book that should be read more than once, it's a short book, so you can do it, but sometimes people forget what they read and then the lessons learned are gone. My favorite part was about separating perception for reality. If you feel you suck at public speaking, is it because you've done it and have failed or just how you feel? Feelings aren't always reality. I also agree that the perceptions others have of us are not always real, so why let them influence us?

A91Z0PZ4TOUOC,Steve Thomas,"In fact, I don't much care for chick-lit at all.  It's mostly designed for 13-year-old girls who know nothing about sustaining a serious relationship, and it mostly sells to old women with arrested development. (Ooh, will Amazon let me insult some of their most faithful readers this way?) And Harlequin tends to be even flatter than some other chick-lit houses.But horses for courses. I love a well-written western story, and it's mostly mindless pap, just as chick-lit is.  If you like Harlequins, this book may be an extreme disappointment. No pirates, no sailing ships, no bodices swelling under layers of clothing that make her shapeless.In fact, it's fairly well-written.  But as I approach the Advent season in a year that's had enough disappointment, loss and stress to be worth a decade, I was looking for a good Western to provide mindless entertainment, something I could read with my mind on cruise control as I lie, exhausted and arthritic, wishing for sleep that won't come, I couldn't find anything that looked good among the westerns.  Thia one looked interesting, though, and part of the reason I war sore and had swollen feet and legs was an incredible scamp not yet two years old. He's the brightest star in my personal heaven, and in my son's as well.  How could this book NOT be the right choice?""Life is tough,"" John Wayne said, ""but it's tougher when you're stupid"",  Unless, of course, you're lucky.  I struck out there, too.  I was stupid enough to judge this book by its cover. and then, once I discovered it was a Harlequin, I kept on reading/  Amazon is ve4y good about taking books back but even if they weren't, what's your time worth? When I'm in pain and struggling to sleep, I wouldn't take $20 to suffer an extra hour of that, and that sure outweighs the cost of an e-book.But stupid me, I kept reading and reading this book.  I won't say I couldn't put it down; I'm of an age where trips down the hall are pretty mandatory. But I kept reading until I hit location 6437 - past the end of the story to a promo for a cookbook of hers that I liked.

Right after their engagement, he left to go on a cattle drive and while he was gone, she married another man.  Jamie has stewed in anger for 8 long years wondering why the love of his life left him for another man.  She has lived in San Francisco during these 8 years and he has never seen her even once.*Minor Spoilers*When Jamie receives word that Victoria has been kidnapped for ransom, in his role as U.S. Marshall, he searches until he finds her so he can return her to safety.  Once he completes his mission, he will barely speak to her on the trip home. Unbeknownst to Jamie, she has had a very difficult life during the past 8 years but she's not going to bare her soul to the man who acts as though he detests her. Along the way home, it seems Ms. Davies must include a couple of encounters between Jamie and his whore of choice at the local saloon while he leaves Victoria in the hotel lonely and hurting.  This part I hate.Once Jamie gets Victoria to her parents' home, days and weeks go by before they have a semi-friendly encounter.  Then, more days and weeks go by before the ice begins to break.  There is very little romance in this book.  The book is 75% complete before Jamie and Victoria actually have any breakthrough in their relationship.  In fact, they are barely speaking to one another.I enjoy romance novels and the build-up toward the characters HEA.  In this and in the first book in this series - Tougher than the Rest - there is quite a bit of strife and very little romance until the end of the book(s).  Both books in this series are rather short - more novellas than novels.I do find the MacLaren Family to be a very interesting family. Also, minor characters such as Gloria and Sam and their relationship brings an added flavor to the series.  I love the fact that someone like Gloria, former saloon owner and prostitute who has a heart of gold, has the potential to marry a good man like Sam and have friends and people who accept her in spite of her past.  This is quite rare in books written about this time period.Shirleen Davies is an excellent writer and I look forward to Will's and Drew's stories.  I wish the books were a little longer but only if more pages could be be given over to romance between the H/h and I'm not talking about a lot of sexual details - just plain old kindness, a dance or two, some comfort, loving conversation, hugging, kissing, sitting in lap stuff - that's what I'm talkin' about!",Very Few Pages Given Over to Romance,"08 22, 2013",3

A10PEXB6XAQ5XF,Michael Gallagher,"This is a fairly short work, and took me about an hour to read - in that short period of time, the author did a great job of quickly pulling you into the action as well as his characters.  Without having a spoiler, I think he did an even better job of having you mentally picture the surrounding countryside and events taking place, which is impressive as compared to a full-length novel due to the limited amount of words on the Kindle.  You feel like you are right there instead of an observer reading along with the story.  I could see this one being expanded from the shorter format to a full-length novel.I picked this up for free during a Kindle promotion and, as I write this review, I see the pricing has reverted back to 99 cents: you will certainly receive more than 99 cents worth of entertainment value out of this one!",Excellent Tale - Could Be an Outline for a Full-Length Novel,"12 7, 2012",5

A1TRZCZUG1T1HO,"M. Moran ""at Books and Whimsy""","Well, this is awkward.  My first read of 2014 &#8211; one I was anticipating because I felt sure it would be AH-MAZING &#8211; ended up alternately boring me, and making me put my rage face on.  Over and over again, I see-sawed between wanting to yawn, and wanting to punch the characters right in their immature faces.  Me After You was a TOTAL failure for me in just about every single way.  It gets one star because I finished it, and because there was ONE side character that was pretty awesome.I guess I should start with the characters.  As mentioned above, I liked Aiden, the only character with ANY redeeming qualities: he was sweet, supportive, and honest.  The others were varying degrees of douche-canoes and failbombs.  Sawyer, our main female spent the entire book a) whining, b) lashing out at EVERYONE around her, or c) refusing to go after what she wanted for lame reasons.  Dean, our main guy, was a class-A JERK, who had a few moments where I ALMOST liked him&#8230;.but then he&#8217;d ruin whatever progress we were making.  Dean is a cardboard &#8220;bad boy&#8221;, who treats the women in his life like poo, then can&#8217;t believe they don&#8217;t want to be with him.  We know how I feel about THAT type of character.  But so Dean rides a motorcycle, and is &#8220;bad&#8221; and goes around randomly ruining lives.Seriously, though.  I tried SO hard to like Sawyer (or &#8220;Soy,&#8221; as her brother inexplicably calls her), or Dean.  (I hated Sawyer.  I just can&#8217;t even with her.  I TRIED, but when she shut her brother out of her life for EIGHT MONTHS, the brother that called her all the time to check on her&#8230;.no.)  Or even her parents, but they weren&#8217;t fleshed out at all.  Their daughter was grieving (and then at times NOT grieving) and they never really did much other than say &#8220;there, there,&#8221; and draw her baths.  Bad parenting, yo.  Her dad was in the book for maybe two pages, and her mom was sweet but basically neither of them had personalities.  (I actually felt BAD for her parents, because Sawyer was a total shrew to them so many times.)  Although I preferred them to Alix, Sawyer&#8217;s best friend.  Alix is a stone-cold WITCH.  Let&#8217;s take a look at Alix&#8217;s FIRST entrance into Me After You, shall we?&#8220;If I&#8217;d known getting rid of your husband was the way to finally get you back here, I&#8217;d have done it myself.&#8221;And that&#8217;s just ONE example of the vitriol that regularly spews from Alix&#8217;s mouth.  This woman stabs Sawyer in the back, insults poor Aiden who just wants to date her, is a witch to Dean regularly (which granted, he deserves some of that), and is an all-around horrible friend.  I guess Hayes wanted Alix to be a &#8220;tough-love&#8221; type character, but it backfired, and badly.All the relationships in Me After You are unhealthy, too, and that was another 1000 points against it.  I HATE unhealthy relationships &#8211; be it unbalanced friendships, or romantic relationships.  They aren&#8217;t attractive, and they don&#8217;t make me happy to read about.  And in Me After You, we have several gems like this&#8230;I wasn&#8217;t planning on talking to Sawyer.  I wanted to see her face.  That girl is a freaking drug, and I&#8217;m going through withdrawals trying to keep away.And Sawyer was forced to &#8220;quit&#8221; Dean &#8220;cold-turkey.&#8221;  NO NO NO.  LOVE IS NOT A DRUG.  SAY IT WITH ME.  LOVE IS NOT A DRUG.  Time after time, these two referred to each other as a drug, hurt each other with words and actions, made decisions for the other without asking, and were SO unhealthy.  My favorite part was when we learned (at the very end of the book) why Dean initially left, and it&#8217;s the BS trope of &#8220;I did it for you/her/their own good.&#8221;  I will say, I did give Sawyer credit for telling him how wrong he was.  Because he was.  And?  He did it as coldly as he could, and for a LAME reason.  Instead of sticking it out, he RAN, and AMEN SAWYER:&#8220;You should have let me make that decision.  I don&#8217;t know why everyone thinks they know what I want or need better than I do!&#8221;AMEN.  Leaving and ending a relationship to &#8220;save&#8221; the other person?  Does the opposite.  It hurts them.  It leaves them with unanswered questions and unresolved feelings.  You end up damaging the other person, not hurting them.  And this makes the relationship &#8211; even the ending &#8211; EVEN MORE UNHEALTHY.  Why do authors write about this?  Whyyyyyyyyyyy.  It&#8217;s a) unrealistic, b) annoying, c)a cop-out, and d) lazy, lazy storytelling.The characters, obviously, were all a hot mess, and the &#8220;romance&#8221; was emotionless, except for the RAGE FACE I put on every time Sawyer and Dean were in the same room.  Seriously.  They kept insisting they belonged together and I never got WHY.  Sawyer was all &#8220;YOU&#8217;RE SO SPECIAL, DEAN,&#8221; and from what I could tell, &#8220;special&#8221; = &#8220;hot.&#8221;  They were very insta-love-ish in high school &#8211; apparently she mildly stalked him to get to know him, and he asked her out even though they&#8217;d never spoken, then from there we had a series of flashbacks showing them falling in LURVE.  (Oh and don&#8217;t even get me started on the fact that he asked her out ON A BET.)And that was something else I hated: the flashbacks.  Stuck in the middle of almost every chapter, they were WAY over-done, and most of them were unnecessary.  The odd thing was that a lot of them were out of order, but we didn&#8217;t KNOW that.  You&#8217;d just start reading, expecting it to be where the other flashback left off, and it was in the past/future but out of the timeline.  So weird.There were some moments of potential for the story and writing, and I think a LOT of the issues comes from the fact that Hayes needs to hone her writing style.  There were some REALLY awkwardly worded passages, and things like how time passed wasn&#8217;t handled well.  In the middle of one chapter, we skipped forward several weeks, for example.  Me After You would have greatly benefited from an editor.Finally, I just had too many issues overall.  A lot of the dialogue was really naked &#8211; nothing around it to tell me anything about how the characters are acting, and too many dialogue tags.  I didn&#8217;t care for the ending, or the way it all clumsily came together.  The MOST emotion in the whole damn book was the epilogue, and I will say, if the whole book had been as good as the epilogue?  I would have loved it.  But nope, no luck there.  Me After You was a hot mess from beginning to nearly end.",A Hot Mess From Start to Finish,"01 17, 2014",1

A2C1UMOOH5PFGZ,Charles Steed,"First, I very rarely read romance novels though I'm glad I had the opportunity to read this one. The authors have woven a story that is rich with intrigue and tension. What I mean is, they've done a beautiful job painting the interaction between the two main characters. As a reader I really wanted these two to be together but that happened only when they were ready. The tension between them up until that point continued to build, making the story hard to put down.There was also an element to the story I hadn't expected, danger and adventure. And it was well done. I grew fond of main character and was very pleased that there were a couple of dimensions to her personality that I hadn't expected.I feel there were a couple of things that would have made this book even better. The story gets off to a fast start. That's a good thing but in this case I believe the authors would have done well to develop one of the characters more and expand the story a bit giving more background information on a particular situation. In fact, this novel would perhaps been more fun had the entire story been broadened a bit. Same for the climax. I felt it came and went much too quickly and would liked to have seen more of a buildup and a couple of characters reap what they sowed. Maybe in the sequel. There is a sequel, right? Still, I very much enjoyed the book and would recommend it.",Wish It Was Longer,"04 28, 2014",4
A37J3XRX1TENTS,S. Richards,"In the Dedication, the author writes,""To everyone who loved 'Staking His Claim' and asked for more of the same."" And this hero is definitely in that same vein: a sexually aggressive, physically dominating, and possessive alpha to the extreme. John is gritty and all-male, a very un-PC, throwback kind of guy who would love to rip your bodice for you. He's a man who knows well how to do bossy and pushy; he's just that used to having his way and getting what he wants, and he wants Sarah, right from first glance.Like Raul (Staking His Claim), John will rub some readers the wrong way, no doubt. He's just too over the top in his masculinity, too abrasive and too hard-edged not to rub somebody up rough. He tells Sarah, ""I don't know what your hold up is. I want to sleep with you. That's all I want. So simple."" Now, why didn't the woman just jump when he said to and land in the bed, ready for him? That's John, rough and to the point, and I loved his cheek and his utter gall. He has that scary intensity that would back any sane woman up in her tracks, as it did Sarah, and I loved that rough boldness about him.I even loved his manhandling ways. He'd just reach out, grab Sarah by her wrists, pin them above her head, and push her body up against a wall or door, crowding her in every way, mentally and physically, trying to intimidate her. As I said, his need and lust are just scary intense. The whole time I was reading the story, I could feel his urgency to have her, his need to own her and to possess her. He tells Sarah that nobody can have her but him. And you know he means it.As for Sarah, she did manage to hold her own against John's intensity and aggression. Although not as physically strong as John, and there are times when she's stunned speechless by what he says and his actions, she doesn't just roll over and let him have his way all the time. And it's her resistance to him when they first meet that really locks his attention on her, making her not only the source of his lust but also a challenge to his ego. Sarah was like a red flag waving in front of him.Her resistance and his coming at her time and again created an interesting and teasing dance of retreat and charge, making this interaction between John and Sarah full of sexual tension, hot and very sexy to read. I read this for the alpha male, and I wasn't disappointed. It had the intensity I wanted, the passion and need, as well as an epilogue that added some sweetness and a softness to John. If you love a very aggressive, forceful, dominating, caveman hero, then this is a romance for you.","When John says to take your panties off, he means right now.","08 11, 2012",4

AXRYJ641PPIDW,Alline,"I would have liked the story much better if the heroine had flaws. I know this is fiction, and a willing suspension of reality is part of the reason we read, but a heroine who lacks any tinge of imperfection makes the story a myth. The story just didn't move me at all. I think the writer simply tried too hard to make the heroine likeable. A decent plot became bogged down by hackneyed expressions of the heroine's many, many, many virtues. Her ""ethereal"" (that word over, and over and over again) beauty was mentioned all throughout the story. She is utterly selfless, dotes on young children, fights as a fearless warrior, defender of the weak, is loved by men and all beasts alike, an expert in the healing arts, a scholar of ancient languages. I found myself rolling my eyes throughout most of the story. I liked the story's premise, and I would recommend this book but with reservations.","A good story ruined by a ""perfect"" heroine","11 13, 2013",3

A9G85AO0S9UTB,Meghan,"Sheena Hutchinson&#8217;s &#8216;Seraphina: The Awakening&#8217; easily stands out from the recent crop of paranormal fantasy romances with its clever writing, intense pacing, and intricately woven plot. Sheena is one author you must follow&#8212;if this current book is any indication of her talent, then it&#8217;s safe to bet there are more wonderful stories where this book comes from.Sera used to be an ordinary young woman&#8212;although attractive to boot, with an air of mystery about her, Sera nevertheless led a largely uneventful life&#8212;that is, until that accident. Something has been unleashed by that accident&#8212;not only internally (Sera starts having strange, previously unknown sensations that make her feel sort of powerful), but also externally (she&#8217;s beginning to get all sorts of attention, most of it she wouldn&#8217;t want). Worse, she doesn&#8217;t remember the accident&#8212;the event itself, and the surrounding details. And while still struggling to piece it all together, Sera finds herself thick in a world she never knew existed&#8212;a world of mythical beings that meddle in the lives of mortals. And if that&#8217;s not enough, Sera is not supposed to stay on the sidelines&#8212;her life and her role in the universe is so pivotal she has to make a &#8220;do or die&#8221; kind of decision.Needless to say, this is the kind of book that will compel you to keep on turning the pages. So a little caveat: avoid reading this if you have some work to do. But on a free weekend, or if you can spare a sleepless night, then spend it reading &#8216;Seraphina&#8217;&#8212;it&#8217;s going to be one heck of an experience. Overall, &#8216;Seraphina: The Awakening&#8217; is a deeply entertaining read: for fans of the genre, this is a book you&#8217;d love to devour in one sitting.

A2FO5R2D6DCZMU,CC,"Imagine if you wil the St Valentines Day Massacre on steroids that's right you heard it correctly, America has a new standard of Chi Town Gangster in the 21st century and his name is Damon. This character could have been created at Starbucks if Robert Ludlum and Russell Blake sat down for a latte and creative character building game. It is a complex storyline if you don't enjoy multiple story lines interwoven this will convert you. Written brilliantly Psymon has depicted Damon's story from the inside out, The reader gets to feel the personal astonishment and outrage at a perceived miscarriage of  bad boy justice. He is the antithesis of the anti hero with a weird dedication to right the wrong.By the way it should be noted this book is a little sexy too. There is something very attractive and engaging about this guy although admittedly you wouldn't bring him home to dinner with mom. Well unless you wanted her to never have a decent nights rest for the entire next decade. I hate to give away spoilers to story lines and in this case to discuss this complex story line and not give away a kernel that does not link to the rest is tough. So suffice it to say this bad boy is like a roller coaster ride so be warned it won't stop in the middle of the action to let you catch your breath. Just hold on and read through, it will slow back down to a coast speed. . . for a moment.I enjoyed the book my one note would be the cover is not a bit SEXY beef it up give me a pile of black caviar in a beautiful silver bowl on a great mirror that is Damon SEXY. Let me see it in the cover. My only negative note would be like most indie books it could benefit with some editing not alot but just a little. It did not detract from the enjoyment of the book but I'm just saying for you grammar Nazi's out there,I'm rating this well worth the read but come on Psymon sex up that cover LOL",Move over Al Capone There is a New Gangsta In Chi Town,"03 5, 2014",5

AU510CVD9XDG,"4Nbahu ""Free Book Hunter""","This book is a collection.  It includes the same information as ""Santa Through the Years"" books 1-5.When I read a children's book, I look at originality, theme (and did they keep to it), lesson (would a child learn the intended lesson), for pre elementary I look for large bold illustrations.  Easy to read and recite language.While reviewing,Santa and His Reindeer - Book 4 (Santa Through the Years),  the author commented the following ""I found these lovely old pictures and wanted to use them to tell the Santa stories all in one place."".  I do not have an issue that she found some lovely old fashioned Santa Claus illustrations, which had probably been postcards or Christmas Cards.  My issue is that not all of the illustrations ""fit"" the story as she is telling it.  Then to fill in she would mix style of illustrations: clip art, cartoon, silhouette, sketches and even a photograph.  Some are exquisitely detailed while some are so simple as to look like coloring book pages.The other issue I had was that she did not create her own story, actually the book isn't a story, but a series of factoids. As she stated in her comment ""Of course, I didn't want to confuse children who might have read other stories. I simply retold the story in my own words, inventing a lot of new ""facts"" I knew children would love."".  In the previous books she had not even acknowledged that parts of her book came from ""Twas the Night Before Christmas"" by Clement C. Moore and some came from  ""Rudolph"" which was created by Robert L. May and put to music by Johnny Marks originally for the Montgomery Ward Company. My main issue with this ""retelling"" is that parts of the book are written as if it is a treatise on Santa Claus, telling about St. Nicholas and that Elves are from Finland.  But then the author brings in the above mentioned fictional works and uses the information in them as if they were facts.At least in this book she has given both of the above credit on the copyright page.  However, she also uses information from the animated ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"", which is not acknowledged.When I got to the rumors portion of this book I kind of cringed at the thought that a baby would be born with a white beard saying HO HO HO or that the poor elves had to use gift wrapping for bed sheets.When I arrived at the ""Christmas and Santa Today"" section the first thing I saw was ""All the world is happy at Christmastime."".  Although that would be a lovely thought and I realize young children don't need to be told that not everyone has a happy Christmas.  I feel that statement is totally unnecessary as well as a lie.  There is a statement about snowman that is jarring and doesn't fit the theme of the series.So if you want a hodge podge of a variety of styles of illustrations, mixed with some fact and some borrowed fiction, with some strange questions to make this ""interactive"" then buy the book.If you want something that is original and follows a theme.

Honestly, I found it hard to get into at the beginning, but I was able to get a good connection going through just sitting down and reading it without distractions.

It was a great story, and you could really feel the emotions going on by both sides.  In terms of Mischa, I felt like he really did fall for Lauren, and due to the business with his Russian family, it was hard to even keep that love alive.

It grasped me in it&#8217;s clutches from the first page and didn&#8217;t let go until I had read the last page. The protagonist is a woman named Rune Alexander. In one word, she&#8217;s a badass. At first glance, she&#8217;s a tough as nails, strong, independent woman. Then you find out that she&#8217;s in an abusive relationship and it really makes you wonder why. She may be strong, but she has some dark monsters that she feels she has to be punished for. Rune runs the Shiv Crew, their motto is to protect humans from the Others; vampires, werewolves, ghouls, etc. The whole crew was pretty amazing, including Ellie, Rune&#8217;s gay best friend. He provided some comic relief in the midst of a pretty dark book. The antagonists are a group of &#8220;Dark Others&#8221;, paranormals that are rogue, and Church of Slayers (COS). COS seems like a pretty bad group, but I can&#8217;t wait to see what kind of trouble they stir up for Rune and the gang in the next book.

A1MDO8RZCZ40B0,ilbob,"A book I got for free recently.It is more a collection of essays and short stories than a book. Anthology is maybe a stretch. Not much that ties them together other than the tin foil hat the author wears quite proudly.The writing is pretty good. The essays and the stories could be better if he did not go on and on and on and on and on with his way out there politics and world view. I don't have anything against the view so much as  the repetitiveness gets in the way of the story and of the essays.One essay was basically suggesting setting up snipers to deal with rioters. It was probably 5 times as long as it needed to be to just say that in an effective way. Incidentally, sniping at rioters is not that bad of an idea if things get that bad, but the essay just took too long getting there.I also think he is way too optimistic about how cops in general will react to general lawlessness by government. I have seen very little that suggests that enough of them would come riding in to rescue the rest of us as a couple of his stories suggest.

A3S6YHRC5P0K8Y,Jen,"This is the second in a series Lucas and Victoria's story. First of all, the editing, word, tense use, and grammar are really bad. I suspect either the author uses English as a second language or doesn't have a basic grammar or spelling check on their computer.Second, it's not a bad storyline (I love sci-fi) it's just kind of hum drum and the dialogue is kind of stilted. Lucas is somewhat superficial, harsh, and mean one minute then in love and protective the next. Seriously he yells stuff at Victoria like shut up, don't f@%#ing touch me and then he's making up for his temper. The steamy scenes were bland.I am having a hard time finishing this I am almost done and don't really care to keep going. Her other two books were better.

AOOKOW8EYLEWE,A. Ludwig,"Good news:It had a cute storyline, continued from the first book, once you dig past the horrible grammar and punctuation. The author didn't appear to know anything about the technical side of space travel, so she wisely skipped over it. A scientist created the means, and others used it. Great choice. It didn't leave massive holes in your story or create places for people to pick. You just suspend disbelief once and go on. The biological compatibility issue was dealt with in close to the same way--using an old standby tropism: space seeded by a master, advanced race no longer around.Bad news:Her writing techniques didn't improve much. After reading a few books--including this one--over this holiday week, I had to write a blog about the wrongness of writers who don't know enough about the words they use. You can find it here: [...] .For specific examples from this book, I started highlighting a few at Location 272*: ""Her mom had an offer to come consultant on a..."" should be ...to come consult on a...; at Loc 629 ""...two sets of stairs - one lead up, the other lead down""  should be led which is the past tense instead of lead, which is either present tense or a very heavy metal; Loc 643 ""a package of plactic tie straps"", which any spellcheck would catch (including the one in my browser--had to undo it to keep the error) the she meant plastic tie straps; Loc 645 had ""strenght""; Loc 744 brings us ""cummutable diseases or anything"" where she meant communicable (I hope); Loc 420 continued an awkward fallacy from book one: ""Prime male had a physical and emotional chemical reaction bonding them to a female""; and many, many more. Sadly.I really hope the author reads this review (&/or the blog) and hits the books a bit before she goes back to writing. Or at least before she publishes again. I'd really like to see stories like this get treated like grown-up work, so grown-ups can read it without wincing.* All locations were marked using my Kindle for iPhone app. Locations may differ on other devices.","Cute story, bad writing technique","11 24, 2012",3

It is my fault that I did not pay attention that this is not a KJV, but that's ok; the problem is how it is laid out.  When I looked a this Bible I got to see the book of Genesis, it would have helped if I could have seen the book of Psalms. PSALMS  does not list the verses the same way as other Bibles do. With this book the verses are listed with the first verse numbered at the heading, so each verse off by one, starting at Psalm 3. Also, and more important to me, Psalm 10 is included in Psalm nine!?

I have always enjoyed all of Breanna Hayse's books but I instantly fell in love with this one because it made you look at things differently.  With Regan being blindfolded she had to rely on her other senses to experience everything that was happening to her and it made the scenes ten times better and made you appreciate what was happening that much more.  This book had everything a great BDSM book could ask for with the alpha male Jay taking Regan from her comfort zone quite literally to bondage, rough sex, anal play, fisting, plenty of spankings, and of course sweet loving making and Jay giving massages to Regan several times. It also showed how much more the trust was needed in this type of relationship seeing as how she literally was one hundred percent dependent on him several times throughout the book.  This book also had some BDSM play I had not previously been introduced to including pony play which I found very intriguing.

Bill has evil intentions with building the house and even bars the windows to keep people in.  To sum it up with out spoilers, Bill and his partner, Tyler, cruise the streets to find boys to bring home to party, but they aren't supposed to leave.  Bill eventually gets sick and dies leaving the house to Tyler.  Tyler is intent on finding the mansion's secrets Bill had mentioned before his death and goes crazy doing so.This novella was ridiculous with terrible writing.  Details were thrown in for no reason at all and there were paragraphs that had nothing to do with the story.  The writing is cheesy and cliche' and I wouldn't recommend it at all.

AXIAY5YTMA2VW,Michele E. Davis,"I found this book on Twitter and I must say, it's a cute little read. It doesn't take long and most of the characters are CHARACTERS: funny, silly, drinking, teasing, nice people. Olivia is the primary protagonist and she has been kicked out by her husband and is staying at her parents house over the Christmas holiday while they are in Hawaii. Her brother James shows up and sweeps her off to a mansion in the middle of nowhere to visit James' friend and co-worker Rory. Rory occasionally lives at home with his mum, Molly; the cook, Martha; his brother Max and Max's girlfriend Reba (which is short for Rebecca). Reba is a horrible, pretentious person who really wants to get a hold of Max's old family money. Reba wants to be ""lady of the manor."" I personally despise the name Reba, it makes me think of awful Yank singers.Olivia, or Livvy (which immediately made me think of Liver and Onions, and Reba is uncouth to point out it does for her as well) as she is called, is devastated by her husband William. Livvy bares her soul to the drinking Molly and Martha before Christmas. Max it seems can read minds and knows that Livvy was beaten and sexually abused by William. Livvy did not come across like that, but what I found fascinating is the fact that her parents, when they came back from Hawaii (and going to Hawaii from the UK isn't cheap!) were displeased with Livvy and ignored her. It seemed, according to Livvy, that they believed William instead of her, liked William more than her, and they chose to not speak to her. Livvy was really on her own.Now Livvy does come across as pretty naive, James not so much, and Max and Reba an odd pair. Molly and Martha are as one would expect two older women to be. One the current lady of the manor, the other the help who is the confidant of the lady. They are silly and a bit nutty, but pretty typical of old-style money situations.We soon discover that Max's heart has been broken three years prior, by the Minister's daughter no less, and he is insulating himself with the attractive, yet crass, money-grubbing Reba. His mum, Molly is a hoot, her husband Fred dead, what better way to spend time then drinking with the cook over the holidays; they certainly are a lonely time. The holidays are the worst, and the book brings strangers and family together very well for Christmas, Boxing Day and New Years Eve.The book does take some suspension of disbelief. We, as readers, have to acknowledge that William and Reba are going to get away with anything because Molly doesn't want to see her son hurt or affected by bad press. I grew up in an old money family where appearances are everything, so I understand this mentality, but it's hard when Livvy has been so abused by her husband whom she trusted with her chastity and she can't even speak to her parents about it. Max seems to want to take his time, he seems to understand Livvy is damaged, yet they end up having sex on the beach. A quickie of sorts, and it is a bit shocking to consider Livvy was abused, Max can tell, but then would take advantage of her in such a manner. Additionally, Reba's resources to prove a fake pregnancy are incredible! I wondered how that was possible. So, as I stated, you need to suspend disbelief, because, for example, while Max can seem so smart, you'd think he'd have Reba checked by his personal physician to see if she was with child, instead of people she could pay off to falsify that she was pregnant. Max seems gullible in some areas and not in others, and they don't mix well, those issues.We are shown, one night when Molly, Martha and Livvy are drinking that Livvy was a cook, and a good one at that, for nine years, before her marriage to William. Because of Livvy's personality (naive, a bit blind regarding what's in front of her) and her experience as a cook, she is asked to replace Martha as the house cook. She does, and what I find so sad is that she is really lonely. Livvy just wants to be accepted, and her parents don't seem to be of the accepting sort. But Reba and William trying to rob Molly's home comes as a bit of a shock. It appears the two will go to enormous lengths to get what they want, it's almost surreal.Numerous events in the book, the dogs, the seals, the interactions between everyone, make it a super easy read. There are some typos and grammar issues, it could have used a diligent editor, but not so many errors that it makes the book unreadable, which has happened to me with books found on Twitter.@krautgrrl says a cute little read with a nice, sweet happy ending; an ending that Livvy deserves after all she's been through.",Cute book!,"10 9, 2012",5

A1HAX9F7HY0D5V,"Casey M. Britton ""C. Britton""","Review for Ramblings From This Chick. ramblingsfromthischick.blogspot.comWow this book was really good. It was such an emotional read, and I will admit that this one had me sobbing as I was trying to finish through tears. I really liked it though, and I loved the characters. Full Measures drew me in from the very first page and I couldn't put it down. After reading this book I cannot wait to read more from Rebecca Yarros. This book is so much more than just a love story, and I know it will stick with me.Ember's life shatters when the soldiers knock on her door and deliver the news that her dad is never coming home. If that wasn't bad enough, it happens on her birthday. Not long after, she finds out that her boyfriend and her roommate have been sleeping together as well. Ember breaks up with her boyfriend and moves back to her hometown. She transfers to a local college in order to help her family out. Ember finally begins to heal with the help of her high school crush Josh. He was always the bad boy who was never wanting when it came to girls. Now he is her little brother's hockey coach and is also completely different than Ember ever expected. Ember is hesitant to start a new relationship after everything that has happened, but Josh isn't willing to let her go without a fight. Ember finally sees that Josh is worth taking a risk on and they begin seeing each other. But when a secret comes to light about Josh and his future, can Ember get past it and take a chance on love?I really loved Josh. I thought that he was sweet and kind and also really sexy. He was in great shape from playing hockey and he could have any girl he wanted. But I loved that despite that, he was determined to have only Ember. He was patient with her and I loved how he was always there for her even when she thought that she didn't want him to be. I felt so sorry for Ember. She had been through so much, and on top of all that she gave up so much to take care of her family. She always put everyone else first and you could tell just how much she cared about those close to her. I liked that Josh got her to open up and really live life again. Ember and Josh had a lot of chemistry, and you could tell just how much they were attracted to each other. But they had such a strong connection that it was really obvious that they were perfect for each other. I knew from the start that these two had to be together, because there was no other option.Overall, I thought that this book was really good and despite my ugly crying I really did enjoy it. The thing that kept me from giving this one a full five stars was that I felt there was a bit too much push and pull. Even though there was a lot going on and that had happened, it got a bit old after awhile and it started to annoy me. I didn't understand why it kept going on as long as it did, and I just wish there had been less of it. I also thought that there were a few times that both characters jumped to conclusions and that things would have been much simpler if they had just been honest with each other. I really did like all the characters though and I absolutely adored Ember's little brother Gus. He completely stole the show in this book, and I couldn't wait to see what he would say or do next. I also really loved how great Josh was with him, and you could tell that he really cared about him as well. This book was a really good love story, but it was also a story of loss and healing. I highly recommend this one to New Adult fans and anyone who loves an emotional and deep read. This is a must read for me and I think that pretty much anyone can find something to relate to with this book. I know that Ember and Josh will stick with me and that I will definitely be reading this book again. I look forward to reading more from Rebecca Yarros in the future as well.**ARC provided by Inkslinger PR**",Really great read. This one is emotional and deep. A must read!,"03 2, 2014",4

I don't normally read stories on the paranormal and fantasy side of erotica (I typically stick to more women's journal type stories likeErotic Women's Journals - The First Three Books in One Volume) but a friend loaned this to me on Kindle and I really enjoyed the read.  The scenes were hot, the characters fun (now I want a tiger shifter hottie), and it kept me up last night turning pages long past my bedtime.  I think I will have to check out some more titles in this series and by this author.  I may have just discovered that I like paranormal more than I thought!If you are looking for another great read that was recently released, I recommendEROTICA- THE THEME PARK (Erotic Adventures - Women's Journals).

A2KWOOV8S3ON5I,LSparkles,"Can I say that I might be a little obsessed with Melissa Haag after reading the books she has published in this series so far?  I picked the first book up out of review submissions a couple months ago, because I needed a little paranormal/shifter fix and a break from reality.  I absolutely did not get what I expected.  Usually when I pick something out of submissions, I get a moderately entertaining read and discover some awesome author potential.  This time, I was blown away and found myself with a book hangover, shaking for my next fix.  The characters have stayed with me for weeks after reading both of these books.  And I have no doubt, I will be reading them again before the next in series comes out.The amount of thought and calculation put into this series is outstanding.  You can tell that she already has the entire series plotted out and strings you along with little ""ah ha!"" moments throughout each storyline.  There will be a total of six books, obviously, each book featuring a new ""couple"", which is my absolute favorite way to follow a series.  The female characters so far are strong, still with feminine weakness, but also determined in an ""I will overcome"" way.  The male characters are so sweet,  swoony and pig headed that I get a little jealous.  I mean really, who doesn't want a pig headed guy/werewolf chasing after them?There are basically two paranormal elements in this series.  The obvious on is shifter/werewolf aspect.  The other is that the six female counterparts to these male shifters have a supernatural ability themselves, each one different and yet their abilities, I can tell, will end up intertwining.  Now, this is a little confusing to figure out at first, but don't worry, just keep reading, the more you read, the easier it comes.  It is truly fascinating and I can't wait to see how it will all play into each other in the end.Yes, I am supposed to be reviewing (Mis)fortune and here I am talking about the series in general.  So, you want to know what I thought of (Mis)fortune?  I LOVED it.  Freaking LOVED it.  The first was really good, the 2nd was even better.  With the 2nd book in series, a lot of the introduction to the ""world"" is complete and we get to enjoy and discover more about that world.  The supernatural elements start to make more sense and it is exciting to start to see the ""judgment of six"" come into play.Michelle and Emmit's story is sweet, slow-building with aching sexual tension like no other.  Holy cow, I just wanted to shove those two into each other, but it was perfect!  Melissa is SO good at building that tension up, making it sexy without selling out to the descriptive sexed up books that are so popular right now.  Not gonna lie, like those too, but that delicious anticipation is the ace up Melissa's sleeve and it is SO addictive.I don't like to get into details of plots, because I think that is half the fun of reading.  I'll let you discover that on your own.  But, I will say, back off ladies, Jim is mine.  He better get a book and I better have the starring role.Full review on Beauty Brains and Books: http://beautybrainsandbooks.com/?p=2876",Addictive Series,"06 18, 2013",5

A32HE9G1ZGQQRA,Redheads Review It Better,"JJJJJJOOOOOOOOOEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!! (Yep. No backstory. Just going into the review. :) ) I loved Joe. Even more than I love my nerd lover Mason. I was really feeling Joe throughout the book but the more I got to know about him and his past the more I fell head over heels in love! He has some insecurities that weren't the typical that we usually see in the males of our romance world and it just made me go awwwwww and turn to a mush puddle.If Phoebe was an actual person, she would be in my close group of friends and we would get along so well. I enjoyed her in Getting Out of Hand but I instantly clicked with her in this book. She's in your face, bossy, but is everyone's friend and everyone loves her. But what she doesn't know if that Matt, the guy she's convinced she's supposed to end up with, is Matt has made it clear to every eligible male in Sapphire Falls that Phoebe is his. So she doesn't realize what a catch she is until Joe starts showing her that she is desirable. She has a moment where she's freaking out about not being sexy enough and Joe's there and handles it very well. Seriously, he was so great. I loved him so much! (Yes we are back to that. Lol.) It's funny how these two people thought they were supposed to be with other people-Matt and Nadia, who were actually together-but were made for each other.And just like what I talked about in the Getting Our Of Hand Review, these two fell in love pretty quickly and I loved it. I think, for these two, if their love story was drawn out, it wouldn't have worked out too well. (Now I will say there was this one part where they weren't together for a period of time but it's still quicker than some relationships take to form.)We got to see some some more of Lauren and Travis who will be in the next book, Getting Dirty, and I know I will love their challenges that will be thrown their way in their book. I have enjoyed reading Lauren in these past two books and know I am going to like her a lot. :)And again, there is nothing in this book I would change.

An incident happened that lead to bloodshed due to the language barrier of the Lenni Lenape Indians and Jenna and her father.Jenna is taken captive by the Lenni Lenape Indians of the Minisi tribe. Running Wolf takes her back to his people and she stays with his parents in their lodge until the council decides on her fate. In the meantime, Jenna is taught the ways of the Minsi Tribe by Willow Plume who is Running Wolf's mother. Jenna learns quickly and it was decided by Soaring Eagle that Jenna was to be given to Running Wolf as a gift. As Jenna stays with Running Wolf they both start to have feelings for each other, but yet they don't actually know how to show it to the other. They both are stubborn and will not realize they both need to grieve for the ones that they have lost before they can move on with their lives.The storyline is great! However, I felt the romance between Running Wolf and Jenna was long winded. The story should have ended once both Yellow Woman and Stands with a fist have been banished by the tribe.I'm rather surprised that Jenna was able to keep her white name. Once captives whether they are slaves or have been adopted by the natives would have been given an Indian name.

They really scare her and she thinks she is going crazy because what she wants is blood. Little does she know that she was adopted as a baby and that her real family is the original line of vampires. After an incident at a Halloween party where she ends up sucking the blood from a man's cut finger and freaking out, she finds out about her family and that she is really Lady Calista Isadora. She then learns that she is to be ""mated"" which is kind of like an arranged marriage for vampires. But her intended isn't who she wants. In fact she despises him. The one she wants isn't allowed to be with her because of their positions in the household. She is the Princess and he is just a servant. This causes a lot of really heated moments and things just keep getting hotter.

They are older (50's) but it's done in a realistic way that makes you feel like your their with the characters and personalities.I had finished this book last night but struggled with writing a review not because it's a bad a story but because it's such a great story that words are hard to describe it. Deanndra is a classy author who gives a lot of detail. This is more than sex, its commitment. The story is a whirlwind as fate brings these two together.Nikki has blamed herself for what has happened to her family, left a widow she has adapted to being alone. She spends her days working at a local florist shop. When she sees Tony for the first time in the shop, he brings her a sandwich.Tony and Nikki are both as stubborn headed as it gets and sometimes it was hilarious to watch how they clashed. The development of their relationship flows smoothly through. I was happy to get a taste of Vic but would love to see more from him.I recommend you give this book a shot and start with the prequel, The Groundbreaking which is ALWAYS FREE!",A Felicity Nichols/Mad In Wonderland Review,"04 25, 2014",5

A3U41P3MHAEXYU,"L. Sims ""Linda""","Having read the previous books in this series. A Little Bit of Crazy (Little Bits) and A Little Bit of Us (Little Bits). I was really looking forward to Lucas and Loryn's story.Lucas's wife and elder daughter had died in a car crash, he has never been able to move forward with his own life since then. He still has his youngest daughter Amelia, whom he loves very much. But he has no plans to ever fall in love again or to marry. He's still in love with his late wife Crystal.Having recently been reunited with his brother James. Lucas now has a family around him. Then he meets Loryn, she's sexy and beautiful, and Lucas is immediately attracted to her. But Loryn remembers Lucas and his wife Crystal from school. They bullied her, so she's not very receptive to Lucas's interest in her. But can he win her over?This is a very well written story. I was looking forward to Lucas's story, and this doesn't disappoint. The characters are brilliantly drawn. Lucas is my favourite, he's a complete idiot, but a sexy and loveable idiot. Loryn is sweet and loyal. I loved the two of them together, their interactions were at times laugh out loud funny, at others deep and full of emotion. The path to true love is never smooth. The love scenes were sensuous and passionate.The characters from the previous books also feature. I love Maya and James, and their craziness. The cling film incident was hilarious.This is a well rounded read with plenty of romance, a bit of angst and drama thrown in as well. A recommended read",A WHOLE LOTTA GOOD,"08 25, 2013",5

AFUQ93IMBSVR4,Misty Baker,"** A 3.5 Review **I am a hardass.Or at least that's what I like to tell myself.The truth is...I'm a Sap. (With a capital S.) I swoon over fluffy kittens, I lose all comprehension of the English language around babies, and though I tell my husband our DVR is full of ABC Family melodramas simply to torture him, the fact is, I just freaking love them.Let's be honest for a second shall we? There is nothing more compelling than a gaggle of perfectly coifed uber rich socialites. The Princess. The Underdog. The Mean Girl (insert meow.) they are (in a sense) immaculately scripted reality TV body doubles. And while we KNOW we shouldn't watch them (like we know we shouldn't watch a dog chase it's tail for an hour) we just can't help ourselves. It's too damn entertaining not to.Game. Set. Match. is an ABC Family drama in the form of a book. Full of pretty people. Jamb packed with angst filled kissing. Totally cliche. And UNDENIABLY absorbing. (Even if your only interest in Tennis is Paul Bettany via Wimbledon from way back in 2004.)Nestled along the North Carolina coast, the Outer Banks Tennis Academy is the world's most elite training facility. In this pressure-cooker environment, futures are forged in blood and sweat, and dreams are shattered in an instant.Penny Harrison, a rising female star, is determined to win the French Open and beat her archrival, Zina Lutrova. But when her coach imports British bad boy Alex Russell as her new training partner, will Penny be able to keep her laser-like focus?Tennis is all Jasmine Randazzo has ever known. The daughter of two Grand Slam champions, she's hell-bent on extending her family's legacy and writing her own happily-ever-after...until her chosen Prince Charming gives her the just-friends speech, right before the biggest junior tournament of the year, the Outer Banks Classic.With a powerful serve and killer forehand, newcomer Indiana Gaffney is turning heads. She's thrilled by all of the attention, especially from Jack Harrison, Penny's agent and hot older brother, except he keeps backing off every time things start heating up.With so much at stake, dreams--and hearts--are bound to break.The most interesting thing about GSM is that it comes at you from every angle.Whatever do you mean Misty?Well, unlike the books that are traditionally published in this genre (which is a weird mix of YA and NA) we are not limited to one perspective.All three girls (Penny, Jas and Indiana) have a voice. Normally this wouldn't be something I touch on. Multiple POV is not at all uncommon in literature. But Iacopelli's choice to write her characters this way, in this particular genre, gave her an edge.We get to see behind the curtain. Meet the wizard and make assumption based on ALL of the information, not just pieces of it.Is the Princess (Penny) in the story really as untouchable as her peers view her? According to the Underdog (Indiana) no. The Mean girl? (Jas) Yes! Finding out why through their different narratives (both externally and internally) is the hook that won't let you go.The Underdog...does she really deserve to be the target of the Mean girl?Is Mean Girl actually mean? Or is she just misunderstood?The complex choice in storytelling allowed for a complex range of emotions, ultimately making the characters approachable. (Despite their unconventional tennis star upbringing.) And in the end, they morphed into something that can almost be misconstrued as ""likeable.""As for the plot...it was formulaic But in a good way. (Hey..simmer down, it's possible!) I knew what was coming roughly 10 pages before it happened, but I still wanted to know exactly how it would play out. The NEED to know trumps predictable any day of the week. (Why do you think Hallmark movies are so successful?)When it's all said and done, I think the biggest compliment I can give Game. Set. Match is that there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. (Which coming from my over analytical and judgy mind is like handing out an Oscar.) It's fun. It's quirky. And incredibly easy to read. (1 day max.) Perfect for those of you stocking your kindle for the summer.Happy Reading my fellow Kindle-ites and remember: sometimes its ok to be a little sappy.*I received a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.*",A KindleObsessed Review,"05 1, 2013",3

She has a 6 yr old daughter Maya. Across the street from her in the Hawks MC club who's president Talon has had his eyes on Zara for the past 2 years. Once he comes over to Zara's house and kisses her he lays claim to her. Zara, who also has feeling for Talon, fights those feelings. One night Zara's brother Mattie shows up telling her that her parents were killed in a car accident that he doesn't really think is an accident, he thinks David had a part in it. Zara starts freaking out planning to leave town and Talon puts his foot down telling her that now that she is his, she is under club protection and he will do whatever it takes at all cost to keep her and her daughter safe.The secondary characters in this book are awesome. Deanna and Julian together will kill you. Julian is Zara's brother Matt's boyfriend. The first few chapters had me laughing so hard my husband just shook his head at me :) This book does end with a HEA and it will be a series with the 2nd book being on Deanna and Grizzly.

I feel like this character is more realistic with his albatross like drug addiction and cigarettes which have taken their own toll.  He is forced to work a case alone and proves to himself that he is worth something besides his telepathy. The takeaway that I got from this story was more character building with a nice mystery folded up inside.

A3FR7J48O0EPKJ,"Christopher T. Owens ""revbones""","First, let me say that I've been on a bit of a zombie kick lately as looking through my book history on my ereader, among other books I have gone through 28 zombie books in the last 4 months - I mention that since it supports that I have a lot of fresh comparisons to make.The concept of a sealed off Britain is somewhat novel and what drew me to the book initially.  This idea is only moderately explored, I guess as much as most concepts that the book shares with its primary genre, however bear in mind that it seems the author opted to take a possibly full piece of work and split it to essentially sell 2 books rather than one as this book is only around 150 pages.The short length basically this means that there won't be as much exploration into some things as other works might enjoy - but it seems that even with the short length that even less than expected attention is given to things such as character development, or much anything other than a flagrant usage of the word ""operators"".I'm ex-military myself, so I can take military jargon however the overly excessive usage via acronyms and explanations takes away from what little story there is here and assuming that since a lot of it drew me out of the story, I'd guess that for non-military people it would be even worse.As I mentioned before though, great concepts but it really is just a short military mission book that happens to take place in zombie times.  Having spec-ops teams raiding various pharma labs to gather intel to fight the virus is great.  Having the last carrier find its way to Britain is great. Talking about how spec-ops teams from other countries found their way to Britain and teamed up with the gov't there is great.  Unfortunately all these things are given mention, but only for a few quick pages and not explored deeply enough.  I wonder if the lack of depth is a result of the collaborative efforts between authors in writing the book since some chapters and areas just don't flow very well.The basic plot seems to be that while raiding pharma labs and processing the drives and data found, they identify a lab in the US that was close to a vaccine and will have to send a team there to recover what they can and hopefully save the world.  Then they leave to go to the lab via the carrier.  That's pretty much it - which left me confused given all the awesome reviews here.Oh yeah, in addition to regular zombies (unnecessarily called zulu's all the time), and runners (called romeo's) they discover a new zombie that runs up and claws and runs away - just to infect.  The author has an acronym for them as well.  It's like the author learned the military phonetic alphabet and thought he needed to use it for everything under the sun.  Anyway, the new zombies type isn't really explored much more than what I just wrote.  That was surprising to me, to introduce something like that without exploration, and seemed to support the idea that books 1 & 2 are really book 1 but split for some reason (get the same as a non-indie book by doubling the indie book prices?).I had an extremely hard time getting into the book and suspending disbelief.  The constant and unnecessary bombardment of acronyms and their explanations pulled me out of what little I could get into, despite the author mentioning in the foreward that this work wouldn't be as in-depth militarily.  The lack of character development (at least until halfway into the book) may have come too late or was just not enough to get me to bond with or care about the characters.Zombie apocalypse with a military slant is done much better in the Day By Day Armageddon series, Area 187, or The Dying of the Light series or many other books/series.  This might go over well with those totally infatuated with military mission books that place a higher premium on gear/acronyms than plot and character development.All that said, I bought the second book.  I'm curious as to whether the writing style evolved and the concepts are explored in a more meaningful fashion, plus the first book is really just an intro so while disappointed, I'd like to finish the story.**  Update **I finished the second of the series - and while the writing and character development improve substantially, it really supports the theory that it's a single book that was split up into parts for some reason - actually at least 3 since the second book ended prematurely.  I have just purchased book 3, because as mentioned I'd like to finish the actual story rather than what seems like a lengthy couple of chapters.  Unfortunately by the time I do, I'll have spent more on parts of what should be a single book, than if I bought the hardcover edition, maybe that was the goal here?",Enjoyed the concept but the writing was underdeveloped,"02 27, 2013",2

Heroine, Emma, is supposed to be a nerdish teenager who studied art in Paris (where she had a lot of sex) and has come home and made a career for herself as a graphic designer.  She's a sexy, self-confident today's woman who runs into her teenage crush who is a newly-minted attorney on the fast track at his firm.  He is instantly smitten with Heroine who is ecstatic until she remembers that her older sister, the one who always gets the happy ending, wants Hero too.  The book goes downhill from there.Heroine doesn't want Sis to know that she and Hero are getting it on, and spends pages and pages angsting over her predicament.  Sis is promiscuous and uses Heroine's apartment for her lunchtime quickies, says unbelievably mean things to Heroine, and steamrollers through on her way to getting what she wants and damn anyone who gets in her way.  Heroine forgives her because Sis is her sister and &#34;best friend&#34;.  (What's that cliche about with friends like that, who needs enemies?)To make things worse, the author writes at about a tenth grade level -- there aren't a whole lot of grammatical errors, but there's no excitement in her writing; it just drones on.

A9TJRJW8SUINH,Johanna,"Yet another wonderful Christmas story from Josh Lanyon -- and this time about a couple we've already met before. This is a perfect treat -- at any time of the year.I've always felt that Mark and Stephen might be one of the most not-so-obvious couples of Lanyon's. Their backgrounds are so different from each other, the way they think, the way they react to the problems. Still, they love each other so much -- and that is enough, nothing else matters in the end.I Spy Something Bloody (I Spy #1) was the second Josh Lanyon book I ever read and the one that officially got me hooked on his writing -- hook, line, and sinker. And I still find Mark and Stephen irresistible. Maybe the fact that they have such a long history together has something to do with their charm? They have been romantically involved with each other before the series begins, the fact that we know through some flashbacks in the earlier books.Mark's and Stephen's chemistry is intriguing because it shifts throughout their story. In I Spy Something Christmas we meet again Mark and his stark feeling of inadequacy and on the other hand Stephen, who is very unselfish, very down-to-earth. The strong, impulsive, adventurous, mysterious one ends up being the weaker, more insecure one when the relationship stuff is concerned. And the more ordinary one ends up being the stronger one in so many ways. I find Stephen's calm way to take things as they come very reassuring. It's definitely a feature of his character, but I can't help thinking that the way he sees things might also have something to do with their age difference. Him being older and wiser and all...One thing that keeps reader on her toes is the fact that Mark is still in this third story of theirs unable to read Stephen clearly. And that he keeps making the bad situations worse. I can't even count the times I've stand with Mark in Stephen's study heart in my throat while everything is going to hell. And every single time I've been sure that ""This is it. Stephen is going to throw Mark out for sure. No Happily Ever After for these two."" And WHY does Mark always laugh when he really should not? That is a great detail in his character and tells us so much about his people skills (and specifically about the lack of them).I think that the best thing about I Spy Something Christmas is the fact that it shows us how much both men try to make their relationship work by making some sacrifices. Although Mark gives it his best shot a little later than Stephen, he really tries to change for Stephen. And it feels to me that sometime along the way Stephen has realized that he can't make Mark change and that he's just going to adjust to the fact and love Mark anyway. After all, we can't really order someone to change for us, all we can do is change ourselves for that someone. Right?Josh Lanyon always manages to surprise me by making me feel so strongly. For example I found it very touching when Mark went to see Stephen's ex, Bryce, and while he watched Bryce's Christmas decorations and him being busy baking with his spatula and reindeer-patterned apron, Mark thought how well Stephen would have fitted in the picture:""There must be times--times like last night--when Stephen wished for something less complicated. More snicker doodles. Fewer bullets.""Those lines are so funny, they made me laugh out loud, but at the same time they are so heart-rending. So sad. And no doubt, they are at least partly true. I can easily imagine Stephen wishing something like that -- even though that doesn't mean he would ever leave Mark for Bryce.I'd like to think that in the end of this Christmas story Mark was finally in peace with himself and that he'd realized he doesn't need to be perfect to succeed in a relationship. As long as there is love, everything else can be inadequate.Don't miss this little gem.

A1168ILANAUMV8,"Delphina ""Delphina Reads Too Much""","I am a huge Dannika dark fan and love the world she has created, so when I saw this novella, I knew I had to read it.  Of the many things I love about this story, one of the things I love the most is that it is a story in and of itself and you do not need to have reads her Impulse series to enjoy it.  Why do I love that?  Because it gives people an opportunity to dive into her world without the feeling that they are committing to a series.  Mind you, you will probably want to read the series after reading this novella.  There is some slight overlap in that one of the characters has a sibling in the Mageri series, but that will not cause any confusion when reading this story.I do not know how to say what I want to say without giving too much away, so pardon my vagueness with this next bit.  I think the way they initially communicate and get to know each other is what makes the story as powerful as it it.  The situation is all kinds of messed up and yet these two people find each other and the possibility of happiness.  Something each had given up on in the past.The ending is brilliant.  Not because it solves some big mystery, but because it is more realistic than I was afraid it would be and it leaves many doors open for the characters while at the same time being a very satisfying ending.  I will admit that I hope we see these characters entering into the Impulse universe, but if they do not, I feel like I know enough.This is not a YA read.  It is for the 18 plus crowd.  It is not graphic, but the content, especially how they meet, is not for younger readers.  If you love this novella, please give her Mageri series a go.

A3SMV35531YME,BookAddict,"I was fascinated by this story. Eric Thomas tackles current issues and spins them in a way that I could too easily see playing out for real. While the basics are routed in a political environment, I found the story more about the sociological and psychological aspects of group behavior. Through the characters and the plot, we explore how fringe groups turn into cult movements, and how, under the right conditions, people will blindly follow a leader. We see the best in people, when they work together toward a common goal, and the worst in people, when they use their power for personal gain.The plot moves quickly and, in parts, contains gruesome detail. I'm not squeamish, but some of the scenes made me cringe. Still, they worked within the frame of the story and weren't added simply for the fear factor.There is no standout main character, which is normally a problem for me. However, the approach works here, as the story belongs to an entire community.I badly wanted to give this book 5 stars. It is truly memorable and moving. But I had some problems along the way that detracted from the experience. First, this one needs some good editing. The punctuation was often missing or placed wrong, sentence structure was sometimes off, and other minor details that, combined, interrupted the flow of the story for me. The other thing is I wanted more from Max. I needed to see how he got to where he was and what drove his behavior.Despite these minor issues, I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for an unforgettable story.",Powerful Story,"10 30, 2012",4

She knows how to tell a captivating story with well-developed characters and plenty of amazingly effective sexual tension. I really liked the main characters, Claire and Koda, and found myself rooting for them.Most of the writing is good, but some passages had punctuation mistakes and repetition. In places, the writing needs polishing. I wish I could give this novel a 4.5-star rating.

A9KQLVC5YIEWG,A Reading Nurse,"Actual 4.5Even though there is still plenty of humor in this book, I just have to say that there were specific scenes in this book that had me sobbing like a baby! We see Claire and Chris taking some rather large steps in this book. They are planning a wedding, buying and remodeling a new house and both have their careers starting to take off. Claire has been offered an amazing opportunity to become an Entertainment Editor for up and comping magazine where as Chris' band is considering getting back together for some shows and  a new album. They are trying to juggle it all and still be there for Samantha and Claire's father Richard whose health is starting to deteriorate. Will they both be able to have it all or will they start having to make sacrifices?I'm trying to not put too many spoilers in this review so there is a big subject matter that I am leaving out and boy is it one that is completely heart warming. I am a sucker for how Chris reacts to his specific aspect of the story and made me fall in love with him so much more.It was wonderful and sometimes hard seeing Claire and Chris deal with the struggles they encounter in this book, but they get through it together and remain each others rocks throughout the entire process. Even though so many different obstacles are thrown at them, their relationship stayed constant and strong and it was refreshing to see in this book.Another aspect of this second book in particular that I enjoyed, but was seeing the budding relationship between Richard (Claire's Dad) and Chris. Chris having lost his father at a very young age starts developing a beautiful and loving relationship with Richard. Even as Richard's health starts getting worse and worse, Chris is patient and loving and still included Richard in everything. It was nice to see this budding father son relationship and just remembering some of the scenes is bringing tears to my eyes.There are certain books that are absolutely great but end in a way where there are questions left answered and story lines that are never wrapped up, but this is not one of those books. I ended BACK FOREVER, feeling full filled and complete and with a huge grin on my face. These are characters that stay with you, and a story which I will sure to be re-reading many times!Thank you to Karen Booth for an amazing story and for putting up with my endless Tweets :) I will definitely be picking up more books from her in the future!",A touching sequel filled with joy and sorrow,"03 7, 2014",5

A2C4WVT3EDI8R7,AvidReader,"I'm glad this was a free book offering because if I had paid for it, I would be asking for a refund. Not enough character development for my liking. This submissive character is not what I consider to be strong. Her first huge mistake is to meet a man in an unsafe environment. She does not know his name, goes to his condo, allows herself to be blindfolded and leaves with never seeing his face.  This happens, not once but twice!  In the real D/s world of safe, sane and consensual relationships, this would no happen. Regardless of lifestyle or vanilla relationships, a woman does not do this and expect to stay safe.I expected a story with a faster moving pace and not so much detail over insignificant issues.  I don't care what she ordered for dinner and why she ordered it when she went out with her best friend.  What I do care about is the details of the character interactions but these seemed to be glossed over.",Disappointed,"02 24, 2014",1
A2JB0G3OI5253I,bcarkin,"****CONTAINS SPOILERS****Yes, this book was super similar to Lexi, Baby but it was more intense. It took things to the next level and made me feel more... namely more anger towards the main guy (just sounds weird to call him the Hero), Jase, and more sadness for the heroine, Julie. There was also more violence and a couple more skanky witches.There was CHEATING when the H/h were dating, bringing about the same results... and the excuses were WAY TOO weak for me.&#34;What the h*ll am I saying? Julie's not the problem. She's the best thing that ever happened to me. This is all about Mom dying. This sh** does not have one f****** thing to do with my Julie.&#34;So... why did you do it then?  Pathetic Jase, pathetic.And in this case, the slore was Julie's BFF, Bec, who is also a pathetic excuse for a person. I don't care how lonely you are or how you think you have so much in common with Jase.  BFF 101: Leave your friend's man alone!  What a royal b****!!So of course Julie would flee town after that! Can you really blame her? As bad as it may seem to some, I'm glad she followed everyone's advice and didn't tell Jase about Jenny.Unfortunately, she got involved with one horrible, abusive guy. When she's finally able to escape, she ends up going back to her home town. And gee, what do you think happens next?  She finds out that Jase has been pining away for her for the past nine years- while boozing and wh**ing it up of course. Once he hears about her coming home he becomes determined to win her back.A little bit of me has to admit that is was adorable how much Jase loved Julie and Jenny. He pretty much transformed himself upon seeing Jenny which made him oodles more appealing, in my opinion. It still was hard to work through the jealous slores and uncomfortable situations they found themselves though.And I'm sorry, (wait, no I'm not) but I have no sympathy for Bec's &#34;situation&#34;. There is NO WAY I'd ever call her a friend of mine again. Ever. I don't even want to waste too many words on Brittany. Blech!

Since then, I have read all of her books, including Playing with the Bad Boys, the first book in the Mia Ferrari series.This second book in the series did not disappoint me. The Gay Mardi Gras Murders convincingly portrays the world of the Mardi Gras,transsexuals, drag queens and violent family vengeance.  I enjoy Mia Ferrari's smartars attitude and her unflagging determination and ability to solve the problems she encounters.  She exhibits skills that help her deal with people on a sensitive, personal level, earning their confidence and getting them to open up to her.  She also has an irrational dislike for Phil Smythe from the police department, and wilfully defies him,working behind his back to gleefully prove that  she can achieve what his department can not.  In the end she tacks down the murderer, but finds she is not invincible and cannot do everything on her own.  Friends can be enemies, and enemies may turn out to be friends.I liked Mia's personal growth in this book; while she is still bitter about her ex, she comes to realize how important friends are, and understand that she does not need a romantic relationship to be complete.I am waiting for the next book in the series.  This book shines a glimmer of light on new possibilities.

A1GHQUHTVSQXI1,Guardsix,"Not my kind of book.  Too much preaching about a system that doesn't exist.  With 80 billion people on Earth it's no wonder the majority are morons!  The author creates this fictitious Earth civilization and then complains about how bad he made it!  So, write it differently.  If you really are concerned about some part of Earth's current education system, then write about it and promote any kind of fix you might have in mind.  Writing science fiction isn't going to give you a platform to do much of anything, except make some money if a book sells.Anyway, back to the story.  You take four or more idiots from Earth (the one you created) and throw them on a sparsely populated planet and expect them to &#34;do the right things&#34;?  Hardly going to happen.  I'm really surprised they all didn't get killed right at the beginning.  I wonder how the book would have turned out if the airplane the main characters were in didn't just happen to crash in the wilderness?  Of course that wouldn't have made much of a story but that's most likely what would have happened anyway.  I don't see the urgency of getting these kids to a farm so why didn't they just load them up on a boat going up river?  And lastly, the bully Barry was so obvious that smart people would have known immediately that he was to stupid to let go anywhere.  After the shooting incident, he should have been locked up in chains and stayed that way until loaded on the next starship back to Earth.Oh, I really hate these political/social rants at the end of each book.  If you haven't gotten your point across during the book then don't try to explain it further in an editorial or whatever.  And of course, reference the Erin Cox example you gave; you might want to re-check your facts.  You'll find out the young lady, her family and lawyer are all liars.

Told from the perspective of Larry Laughlin, a private detective and reformed (sort of) assassin, this book is offbeat, humorous, and darkly wacky. The conversations snap, crackle and pop. The backstory is slowly revealed as this new case unfolds and I loved the way in which the pieces of the puzzle interlocked.  I was drawn into Larry's world - I wanted Larry and his wife Mo to somehow beat the odds.This book would have easily garnered a 5 star rating in my mind because of it's well-written odd quirkiness and fringe characters. However, ""The Show"" disgusted and appalled me - not in a scary, horrific way, but because I felt it was senseless, irrelevant and just plain gross.  The same end could have been achieved through many other literary vehicles, in my opinion. The reader warning needs to be more strongly worded.

It really feels like Simpson wrote a treatment early on and decided to expand it into a full storyline that he had to merge back into Post Human to make it make sense.The sad thing is, after hating books 3 and 4 I will read book 5, just for the chance that he recaptures some of the magic of the first book (and parts of the 2nd).Sorry David, I know it sucks to read a bad review but this book was pretty bad.

The local F.B.I. agent is called in to investigate when a white, blonde, female child is found on a remote Arizona Mesa located withing Navajo tribal lands. Wounds on the girls body indicate an animal attack, but no blood is found at the scene, however, moving away from the death scene they find bear tracks. Due to the jagged rip in the little girls stomach area the team of Navajo police investigators and the F.B.I. agent are thinking animal attack, but how did the little girl end up at this remote location and why was there so little blood at the scene? A Navajo police official, and friend of the local F.B.I. agent, along with the help of a local woman who trains dogs for tracking and other purposes, follow the bear sign until it appears to morph into human foot prints. From there the story unfurls into a twisted tale of myth, fact, mystery and more horrific deaths. It's a must read for anyone who enjoys a good mystery/suspense/thriller type of tale.

A81K6ZO7ALC7D,Cahm Merritt,Georgette St. Clair writes such great characters and chemistry!  Both the hero and heroine in her new series Timber Valley Pack are no exception.  I think next to Pixie in her Shifters. Inc. series Josephine may be my favorite character of all!The story is great. Bride Of The Alpha is original and definitely unpredictable with some surprises and plot twists that surprised this reader. I cannot emphasize enough - the author just reels you in with her well written characters - all of them - the heroine right down to the town Sheriff.I love that the author gives you a complete story with an HEA but leaves the reader anticipating the next book in the series.  I am always left wondering which of the wonderfully written characters will take the lead in the next adventure.I wish all of her novels were 200+ pages as they never seem long enough..or is it because I do not want the story to end?I highly recommend The Timber Valley series and everything that Georgette St Clair publishes.,A Heroine to Cheer for - Josephine!,"07 17, 2014",5

A3L3LTZ0T0U098,oucat5,"When I first got my e-reader, I purchased book one and after reading that I purchased book two. I stopped there as I felt the story had run its course and I knew where things were headed. When the 3 book set came out, I went ahead and bought it so I could re-read and finish the story. I have to say that I wish I had left it alone. I should have stuck with my original impression. While it was nice to continue the story of Brandon and Spencer, and Jason and Becca, and Max and Ryan, I felt the author threw in situations that were not true to the story just for filler. I also found that I was starting to not like Spencer as much as she was turning into a drama queen. It's obvious that this is written by a young person, but it seems to become even more so as the story goes on.This set reads almost like a diary of a happy young woman's life. She has great friends and family, is college educated with a job she loves, has a great boyfriend with great family and friends, and life is good. They go about living their lives, having lots of sex, and being happy. The F word is used occasionally, and there are some grammar errors. There were also places where I felt the author could use a stronger vocabulary, as sometimes her choice of words was poor. When I think about giving this book a grade, I give it a C. There is nothing here that really makes it stand out.",Might be a perfect fit for a twenty-something,"07 2, 2014",3
A1E33ER4JG5B11,Gigi111,"REVISION: I am revising my post.  This is the very first time I have had an author reply to one of my posts and within a day.  The author has fixed the problems with the download and the story now has all content.  She even had me delete and reload it with no extra charge.  What a courteous thing to do.  I will be sure to look for more books in the future. Thank you Ms Mills for you attention to this problem.  There are too many people in the world who would have brushed the problem aside because they already received their payment.  Let me know when your next installment comes out, I will be one of the first to download!ORIGINAL POST:I read the first two in the series ans enjoyed them.  However, the plots are so very similar and there is a quite a bit of repetition that I skipped through.  The problem with this book (third in the series) is that large chunks of sentences are missing. One second you are reading a sentence and the next you are trying to figure out what just happened.  I believe that the text was in the process of being edited and they stopped.  It makes for confusion and incoherence.  I hope that this will be one of the books that will receive an automatic update if it is ever finished.Now, back to the actual story...as I said, there is a lot if repetition.  If you read the other two books, which you really need to before reading this one, then the explanations of what they are, what their mates mean to them and the bad guys background really doesn't need to be rehashed in each book.  Don't get me wrong.  They concept of Dragon Guards is very entertaining.  I just feel like I am reading the same thing over and over.  This being said, I am looking forward to the next installment.  I hope the editing is better.  If you like The Dragon Kings by Donna Grant and the dragon series by Bianca D'arc, you are sure to enjoy these also.",Somethings missing...REVISED!,"05 2, 2014",4

A3H906VCUE4GD1,Greatdanes,"Really, a 20 mile wide crater/eco system with 20 ton land carnivores and sea creatures weighing many times more? How would that ever be supported and how long would the food supply last?. Almost everything in this book is carnivorous and nothing makes any sense going from there - where's the prey (except for some small armadillo type critters) . The first book was better written and much better thought out.Actually the research in the second book is terrible.According to the story this was a 20 mile wide crater so we have :20 miles  2 = radiusradius = 10 milesArea equals Pi times r times rArea = 3.14  (10 miles)  (10 miles)Area = 314 sq. milesSo, in a 314 sq mile crater you have multiple 20 ton land carnivores and multiple 100 ton water carnivores, plus other large spider like and scorpion like carnivores.What did they eat in that tiny land area? A 7 ton T Rex probably ate over 500 lbs at one meal but was not able to find a meal like that every day. With extrapolation, a 20 ton (warm blooded) dino would have probably then have eaten around 1200-1500 lbs of meat at a meal and the 100 ton sea carnivore, which in the book kills the land carnivore (and presumably eats at least part of it before smaller sea scavengers have their way) probably could eat about 4000 lbs or more, but not as much proportionally (to its size) as the land carnivore since the sea monster had to be cold blooded.So (paleontologist-ly speaking) T Rex probably made up about .01% (or so) of its animal population, couldn't support much more then that population in wide open N. America and Canada land area what did these giant meat eaters in the book possible survive on in only a 314 sq mile land mass?The only prey animals described in the book were smaller critters (perhaps Protoceratops?), and these were too small and infrequent to provide meals for the giant meat eaters described in the book.We know from the fossil record in New Mexico that at least one predatory dino, Coelophysis Beuri was cannibalistic, but if the predators in the book had been cannibalistic over such a small area as 314 sq miles, how did any survive to reproduce?Seems like lots of bad research and science to me.",Not as promising as Book 1,"08 13, 2013",2

A1V5PIKC5NU5OX,Sara,"I really, really liked this book, as always with the Demon Underground books.There were some changes in this book. It wasn't as funny as it used to be with Fang and Val. Maybe because Fang's getting too serious, what with his responsabilities with Princess and the puppies, and Val's lack of strenght and her problem with Lola messing up her life big time. Shade's acting like an idiot didn't help either. He was too damn annoying for his own good. I really wanted to kick his sorry ass in this book! As much as in Make Me. I'm starting to realize he's a selfish, childish, insecure and annoying jerk. He seemed so cute and sweet and hot at first, that even though I still thought he was a tiny bit childish at times, I could see he really liked Val and I kind of liked him. Especially after how Dan hurt her. But since their adventure in Austin (the city) in Make Me, Shade's been acting really stupid and all he's done is hurting Val and blaming her for his mistakes and has put her in danger because he's too stupid to admit she's right and he sometimes needs to be rescued.I am starting to really, really like Austin, instead. I admit that I might have fallen in love with him already. He's near perfect. He's protective but not oppressive, he's sweet in his own way and he's incredibly sexy. He shows his feelings and his need to protect Val without being an annoying Macho Man. I have to say that I suspected since the beginning that he liked Val. Even though she had the impression he wanted to make a fool of her, I knew that his secrets smiles and jokes were because he liked her secretely. And damn, how sexy he is! I love cowboys! One other thing I liked about Austin was his will to finally let Val see how much he cares about her and how much he's into her. He also showed her she deserves better than a selfish child as a boyfriend. She seems more mature than Shade is, even though she's younger.I also liked a lot the scene of Austin and Val on the bed after she healed Shade. How cute and hot! And I also liked the ending. The final scene with Val and Austin. He was so sweet giving her roses and staging a zombie party for her on Valentine's day.The only thing I resent is that we don't even know what color his eyes and hair are. Or did I miss it??? I've been re-reading all the books these days and I haven't found anything about his features but his cowboy hat and his lean, muscled, yummy body. I'm assuming he's got brown hair and eyes though. I'm imagining him that way. Then maybe I'm wrong and he's blond and green-eyed, who knows? (But I hope not) So, I'm asking the author for details on Austin, please! We don't know much about him!The story was good and I couldn't put the book down, not even a minute! The mystery, the fights, the romance, the drama.... all good! I wanted more and more and couldn't stop reading!Highly recommended! And I assure you, you'll fall in love with Austin too! If you haven't yet!Well done, Parker Blue!

The chemistry between Tara and Damien mean that the sex scenes are very very hot!steaming sex explicitly described by the author. Tara's strong will and adventurous nature is refreshing. Loved the conflict between them. Damien is a force to be reckoned with. Not for the faint-hearted. But engrossing and stimulating.

A1U9ULWA5BFQU1,Tiffany A.,"3.5 StarsThe story line was actually quite good.  This book was only a couple of bucks so my expectations weren't high but I was in the mood for some medieval romance warrior stuff.  It wasn't just about the hero and heroine falling in love.Alexa is the sister of the girl that was promised to Rourke.  Now that Alexa's sister is dead, the king has decided that Alexa will marry Rourke in her stead.  Only Alexa has been raised more like a boy and has never intended to marry.  She won't make this easy on Rourke.  And Rourke has scars so deep he won't let anyone in.A good chunk of the story is how these two try to hurt one another because they are scared how they feel and don't want to be vulnerable.  Another aspect of the story is that someone at Barnett manor is trying to kill Alexa or Rourke or both.  And yet another aspect of the story is that a part of Rourke's past that he thought long dead comes back and uses trickery and deceit into acquiring Rourke for his nefarious purposes.At times the lengths that Alexa and Rourke went to hurt one another got tiresome.  They always regretted what they would say, but too many times the author noted that the characters were too mad to care at the time.Overall, it was enjoyable and it was quick. There were a few grammatical mistakes that took you out of the story to try to figure out what the sentence was.","A good, quick read","11 5, 2012",3

A2SPF129OKGORN,Gisela Hausmann,"Philip McQuillan&#8217;s short book is not only wonderfully sweet, loving and deeply touching, it also raises a very important question:&#8220;Who among us can remember, much less write even a scrap about the life of our grandfather&#8217;s uncle?&#8221;As it so happens my family is struck with longevity; almost everybody, who did not die during the war, lived past their 90th birthday. That means that I personally knew one of my great-grandfathers and one of my great-grandmothers. However, since every able man had to serve during WWII I knew neither one of my grandfathers; both of them died at the Eastern Front, in Russia.Which makes Philip McQuillan&#8217;s point &#8211; I know nothing about them! While I have heard some stories, I have no idea how they walked and talked, how they laughed and loved.McQuillan decided to hinder that his father would become part of such a void; he  is keeping his father alive &#8211; with a book. A wonderful writer Mc Quillan created a portrait, which lets &#8220;Big Philip&#8221; (his dad) become a part of every reader&#8217;s life:&#8220;&#8230;He was a man of simple pleasures who loved reading, cooking and getting in a few rounds of golf or tennis. A swim in the ocean, a game of cards, classical music and great literature&#8212;these were a few of his favorite things. It always seemed that whatever he was doing, that was also his favorite thing. I have yet to meet anyone with so few dislikes, so few complaints and such a wonderful acceptance of life just as it is&#8230;&#8221;It turns out that Big Philip also loved poetry and quoting famous authors (&#8216;the masters&#8217;), he also read and reread them. Big Philip liked to prepare chicken (no dinner was complete without a bird), loved the lighthearted competition of a card game, and most certainly his vegetable garden. (The book includes a picture of Big Philip working the garden.)As I am listing only these very few facts I am proving the author&#8217;s point: I know more about his dad than about my own grandfather.I like this author&#8217;s dad. In particular I like the fact that &#8220;Big Philip&#8221; used special words to give his life and his perception of the world his flavor:&#8220;&#8230; his own inimitable brand of understated humor. That, as you can see, was one of his favorite words. Inimitable&#8212;a wonderful word that describes him completely; truly he was one of a kind!...&#8221;Big Philip also liked the word &#8216;connoisseur&#8217; and to me it is clear that he was a connoisseur of life itself. It must have been the teaching of these special qualities, which made his son, &#8220;little Philip&#8221;, reach beyond just telling the story. &#8216;Little Philip&#8217;, now author Philip McQuillan, is encouraging his readers to participate and share stories about important people in their lives. I think it a wonderful idea. Grandfathers are supposed to be story tellers. Once their stories are written down they can stay story tellers forever. Seriously hoping that McQuillan can take such a project off the ground. In theory I could even see it as a sort of project for cultural understanding.

A1R49S89HF1V77,Carly,"Having read all the books in this series, I have to say that this was my favorite.Tatiana is a woman who thought she wanted to the life of luxury of being a member of the Court, but after being left by her husband, she returns to the Court to find that she is damaged goods and the favorite topic of gossip among the members.Adrian finds himself thrust into the life of luxury and a member of the Court. Because of his past, he holds a deep hatred for those in the Court.When they meet, there is a little bit of magic and destiny thrown in, and that is the reason that this book is my favorite.However, as their relationship progresses, Adrian and Tatiana aren't exactly honest with each other about who they are and where they came from. They haven't lied, but they haven't told the full truth, and it all blows up in their faces.Of course, there is danger on the horizon, and we get to check in on the Lady Knights as well as brief visits from the Kings and Queens. The author adds her twists and turns, moving the story along at a great pace, keeping you wanting to turn the pages.Throughout this series, I have always loved the Grandmother, Akira, and her ""abilities."" She is more prominent in this book than I remember her being in the others, and she adds a wonderful layer to the story, and just a small, tiny, hint of paranormal that makes this book different, and in my opinion, more ""magical"" than the rest.",My favorite of the whole series,"04 23, 2013",5

But just after the sample ends, the book becomes rather contrived and unrealistic. The relationship moves too fast- a famous baseball pitcher straight away falls in love with the poor overworked and damaged bar tender. There's lots of tears and emotional breakdowns that should have the reader feeling something, but I didn't feel anything. I will admit I didn't read every page because I just got over the sap.

A1TIOW0XDXYHNU,Christopher,"I should know that when someone who has written 25 romance novels produces a ""mystery"" I should pass on it by default.  This was a daily deal at Amazon and I gave it a chance - big mistake.  I'll give the author credit for decent writing and mediocre character development, but that's about all I can say good about this book.  I stuck with it even though it was pretty clear from the beginning that the major plot was going to be people switching partners by the end of the book.  The book develops a mystery, but the ending was just awful.  Most writers will build a plot that lets the reader along with the investigator/detective come to a conclusion as to the solution to the mystery but this book just lobs an ending at you in the last 2 pages which was not hinted or developed any place in the book.  Furthermore there is a murder committed in the book and when the perpetrator is discovered, the characters just discuss it like they are talking about what shoes to wear - nothing happens, the character just disappears.If you like romance novels than you might like this - although even the romance part of the book was not very interesting and quite predictable.  The grammar and spelling are pretty good - which is getting rarer and rarer in these cheap kindle books but if you want to read a good mystery, or even a poor mystery - look elsewhere.",Dreadful Ending,"01 6, 2013",1

A2W9I628I6SE1U,"Kort ""Art, Music, Book & Movie Enthusiast""","The Sojourn is a book that espouses lofty goals but sadly does not reach them. At least for me.The best thing I can say is that this is a beautifully designed book with striking imagery. I can also tell that it stems from the author's heartfelt emotions and is written with the best of intentions. It contains 35 poems that range in subject matter but are all approximately 16-20 lines in length, a bit less than a full page. Each poem is accompanied by an image appropriate to it's subject matter. I read the entire book in about an hour. There is a Lexicon section at the end that explores the symbolism of the various poems' topics which I found interesting.Did I find it enlightening? Transforming? Question answering? Perception changing?No.While inoffensive, I would put the poetry and content at a grade-school level of competency. Rupansh seems to try too hard to make every other line rhyme with the previous one, perhaps to the detriment of the content. Also, there seems to be a slight language barrier issue, evidenced by some of the word usage. That is even when the poetic license is taken into account. And there are instances where ""big"" words appear to be used for effect and don't seem to be a natural extension of the writing. Overall, this is not a bad compilation of poetry, but it seems more like a project done for a writing class rather than a mature exploration of life's deeper mysteries. There is an 'Extensions' book that appears to attempt some deeper analysis of the original text, but I am not sure of what real value it would hold.I was provided a digital copy by the author for review purposes. My copy also included an excerpt from his novel, ""Pulchritude - An Eternal Love Story"". The issue of English not appearing to be the author's native language is more strongly in evidence here.  Even so, there really wasn't enough of the tale included to create any interest in reading the full story.As poetry can be subjective, there is every chance that you might enjoy The Sojourn. Just don't expect it to live up to the life altering claims made by the author in the Forward or in Book Description above. 4 stars for the intent and motivations that went into this book, 2 stars for the result -- so I'm going with 3 stars.~ Kort",A Valiant Effort,"06 17, 2013",3

I have read most of the books in her Mail Order Bride series and although each one is a stand alone book, she manages to link to characters in previous books. This one has the Thomas children grown up and pursuing their college educations and careers. The author does a great job pointing out the attitude of the time regarding a woman pursuing a career in a male dominated profession. The Thomas ladies are very brave and determined.This is predominantly the story of Jonathan and Laura, but Jonathan's sister Rebecca also finds someone special. Very nice.

A1LENMY5YF7AIP,Love2Read,"I didn't expect to like this story, especially after reading the comments about it.  But, I was pleasantly surprised.The parody this author wrote on the classic Alice Through the Looking Glass is imaginative and creative.  I found myself laughing throughout most of the book as the humor tended to be both obvious and hidden as well.  I think each of Alice's encounters throughout this world held a specific meaning and all had their own share of humor, but I have to admit that I found Humpty Dumpty to be my favorite.  I think I was able to grasp his sense of humor the most and I actually found myself bursting into fits of laughter through both his written sense of humor, along with the visual of his character.While this book is most certainly an erotic adventure that is not for the faint of heart, or for anyone under the age of 18, when you pay attention you realize there is actually a story here and the plot actually does have a meaning and a purpose, beyond the erotica.I would have willingly given this fairytale 4 stars, if for nothing other than the creative sense of humor alone, but the one thing preventing me from doing that was the constant references within the storyline of this being a digital book, what Amazon allows in digital books, etc.  Those parts for me were misplaced and offered nothing to the story itself.  Other than that one quirk, I truly enjoyed it.If you are looking for a creative and far fetched fairytale...this is the book for you.If you are looking for something with detailed sexual and erotic encounters...this is the book for you.If you are looking for all of the above, and a heavy dose of humor that will make you laugh out loud on almost every page...this is defenitely the book for you.",Enjoyable and Creative,"09 6, 2012",3

A3384G16CPDPV,M. Gunnufson,"Wow-this book is fantastic. I learned how to develop charisma from a completely different approach then I originally thought. I mean these are simple things. For example, smiling more. Duh? Right? This makes the biggest difference.People who walk into a room and smile, light up the room. This is so true. Patrick's approach must come from personal experience because he shows with a lot of confidence how to develop your charisma and build rapport through being a charismatic person. What is a charismatic person? More importantly how do you become charismatic?As the book shows you don't have to be good looking. Just be someone who sends out the right energy. What we send out, we get back. So in conclusion I highly recommend this book and I think everyone needs to read this. Why?Like it or not, we need to learn important social skills like charisma. Prince is a good example. He sucked at being charismatic but as the book shows he learned it. It can be learned. Wow. Awesome. Thank You for this!",Wow. What a great book?,"12 3, 2013",5

Stefan is a billionaire business owner and usually does not give interviews, but makes an exception. The interview scene plays out much in the way of the 50 Shades of Grey interview scene - fun and flirty. After the interview, however, the story takes on a different twist.I love the Vampire Diaries and enjoyed 50 Shades (to a certain degree anyhow) so it was an interesting combo. The writing was clean and smooth to read and I think the writer was able to capture the essence of the characters well.

A2UNMDJYXPEQZ3,Gatorfan,"This one did not start well for me.  our heroine is obviously a music teacher and she goes to the student.  Her comment regarding the position of the sun was a little uncalled for.  Then it seems like every other word out of her mouth is crap.  Her back story is that she bought a vehicle and a lot of new band equipment, signed for the loan and then let an ex boyfriend take off with all of it while she held the note.  Not a smart chick here.  Then she is sitting on the bridge daydreaming when it is time to go she sits.  So the car behind her honks his horn to get her moving.  Now, HE IS THE JERK, not her, HIM.  So she gives him the finger and then starts forward when her truck dies.  So he gets out of his car and walks forward, she has no idea what he is going to say or do but expects the worse so she is ready to take him out.  Does this gal have any redeeming qualities?  Not so far.  I don't like her or her bitchy attitude.  So, I am moving on to another book.  This one had lots of good reviews so it is probably just me.

A3TP31S61PPE3G,AlexJouJou,"Lisa Henry is a fave author of mine for her wonderful settings and gritty characters. There is always a plot as well - and I never find the sex gratuitous although it is often raw, elemental, and rough. I'll admit to being a bit confused in the beginning with all the names but it did force me into the headspace of this book. The language barrier faced by the two MC's actually helped me to keep a perspective on it - oddly it interjected some realism into the story. I'm a fan of Ancient Rome stories like this - almost preferring the older ancient culture to the newer historical ones - and certainly here it gets a lot of mention. I went into this story not believing it to be any sort of romance - more a historical piece with some of the famous Ancient situations like torture, slavery, etc. I still don't see it as a romance although there is a slight romantic element to it. I loved the glimpse in (cannot say to historical accuracy..I'm not a historian) but it did transport me to Nero's time and that made it a win.

A1Y1JGJMB321OC,"Jskinz ""Jskinz""","I liked that both leads were broken, and suffered in a similar way. Both Flynn and Evie had been cheated on and humiliated. Flynn knew about being controlled by a sociopathic father, and Evie was controlled by her ass of a ex-boyfriend. Because both of their relationships ended horribly they both separately moved to Alaska to take some time to heal. Unfortunately that is where their good sense ended. Especially Evie's.The idea that they fell in love after knowing each other for about a week and going on one date was ridiculous, even for Flynn the wolf. There was nothing in the book that said Flynn had some mystical mate sense, and he was engaged in the past. His former mate/fianc&eacute; cheated on him and he couldn't scent it on her, so much for animal instincts. Which means wolf and all Flynn is bumbling through life looking for love like the rest of us. Evie was in a extremely emotionally abusive relationship. When she meets Flynn he is a bit awkward and demanding. That alone should have sent her running for the hills. Instead she declares her love for him in spite of his nature and the danger being with him presents. After one date. I also wish the werewolf thing had been explained. Are only males wolves? Are there other packs? If there are why didn't any of them intervene and stop Rupert?The book does not end in a cliff hanger, but the source of true danger is not actually dealt with. I suppose it was necessary to leave a villain for the next story. The villain Rupert, Flynn's father annoyed me because he was just evil for no reason. Everyone has a motivation, insane or not, yet we never get to find out Rupert's. Rupert just runs around killing or trying to kill people all willy nilly. Although there was a lot to be desired when it came to this story I did like Evie's best friend Dana and Flynn's brother Connor.

A3GL8A5HRHSVJJ,Katie L Thompson,"To start with I wasn't too keen on the storyline because although it is a fiction story I believe that it should still be believable. A good writer can make even the most unbelievable things believable and for me this storyline just wasn't realistic. However, the ending (which I'm not going to reveal so you'll have to read the story) made me rethink the whole story and bumped this up from 3.5 stars to 4 stars.The major problem with this story is the amount of errors it contains, from spelling errors to typing errors and quite often the same thing will be repeated twice (e.g. ""He pulled the straps of her dress down""... half a page later ""...reached for the straps of her dress, never taking her eyes off his as she pulled them down""). To me this looks like the story has been published way before it was ready to be released to the public and it's a shame because there is great potential for this story if it had just had a little more time spent on it.That said, I am still going to give this story 4 stars because of the descriptive writing and character development. Reading this story you can imagine the characters of Destiny and James and the situation they are in.

I really enjoyed reading the first book of the series by the author.Having lost her true love 10 years earlier Linden has tried to put her life back together again and while she stays busy being a fundraiser organizer to help the music symphony company. Her life comes crashing down when she sees her first love back from the dead. Cyril is on a quest to find out why he is attracted to Linden. He has memories of bits and pieces of her and he is out to find the truth, 1 way or another.This book is a great read and has such a smooth flow to it. While the characters are all intriguing it is Linden and Cyril's journey that you fall in love with. I honestly have nothing bad to say about this book and I enjoyed reading it.This book has suspense, lies, supernatural beings, murder and sex. Renea Mason treats you to the best of everything in this book and she will make you want more when you come to the end of the book.

A3E9C0HZCUGR5S,Brian's Mom,"Wow, just wow!  An intelligently written book about a tried and true trope:  The forgotten royal.  I love this trope for many reasons and Ms. Long nails every reason why I do.  The heroine is smart, sexy and doesn&#8217;t have a clue about her heritage at all.  The hero isn&#8217;t a douche; yes, he has a reason why he wants her to be a true royal but he is honest from the beginning.  I know&#8230;smart thing that Ms. Long did.  Plus, the heroine agrees but makes the hero jump throw hoops in the beginning but too bad.  This is a story about how a forgotten princess and her billionaire pseudo fianc&eacute;e fall in love.  Sorry but there&#8217;s no deception, no one trying to break them up or do anything stupid.Now, I could say that I felt some similarities with the move Pretty Woman and the character of Victor but Ms. Long gave it a different spin.  Alyx, our heroine, had a presence about her; a familiarity about being a princess.  Of course, our hero, Daniel, stepped in a couple of times to remind Victor that Alyx was tired and needed a break.  *swoon*  Victor has got to be the best secondary character that I have read in a long time.  He wasn&#8217;t intrusive, mean or treated Alyx like an idiot.  When she needed someone, he was there for her; not as a teacher but as a friend.What really drew me the characters was that actually got to know each other as people.  They got to be friends before the sex started.  As I told Ms. Long, I appreciate the fact that I was more than half way through the book before they even had sex.  Sure there is tension and build up but Ms. Long puts Daniel and Alyx in a situation that just perfect for them to finally give themselves to each other.  Trust me, when you read it, you will swoon, fist pump and wish that a lot of other authors would follow Ms. Long on this.  :)If you are wondering where the conflict is, trust me its there but its not what you think.  Again, Ms. Long doesn&#8217;t dumb her characters down or her readers.  Another thing about Daniel and Alyx is that in the end, these two really cared about each other and wanted it to work.If I had one thing to gripe about&#8230;I really need to know if Alyx&#8217;s boxes will ever show up.  I felt like, for me, I needed that closure.  The picture was great that Daniel gave her but I wanted more.  Again, its just me.  I don&#8217;t know what I would do without &#8220;my stuff&#8221; like that.Overall, buy this book.  Give it to your mother, grandmother, aunt, niece really anyone.

A77GNWUKXLO2M,Susan Dawson Cook,"After a painful divorce, Cyn Westland enrolls in graduate school to get a fresh start. She gets more than she bargained for when her Communications class instructor asks each student to introduce himself/herself with an imaginary name. Cyn introduces herself to the class as ""Cleopatra"" and is soon smitten by a man in the class who she knows only as ""Merlin."" Adopting the new identity helps Cyn to move on, but there's a girl in the class named Pandora who develops a grudge against her and starts stirring up trouble.I enjoyed the fresh premise of this story. I wished Cyn had been a bit more patient with her mother--her rude demeanor toward her on some phone calls took me by surprise, but as I got to know her mother better, I realized she was super high maintenance and would be a drag to deal with after awhile. The author did a fabulous job developing the evil quirky character ""Pandora""--I never knew what she'd be up to next and have to say I almost liked her villainous, trouble-making personality.

Her books just seem to get better and better, and I can't wait to see what her brilliant mind comes up with next!I have a lot of faith in this author to tackle any element well, but I have to admit I was a bit worried about this story. She does the romance and happy plot so well, and I wasn't sure how she'd handle the level of angst and drama that this story would require. But wow, she did not disappoint - to say the LEAST! I was honestly blown away by what she did with this book.

It is quite short and resolves nothing. I am used to thinking of a series as books that could stand alone but may leave a dangling story line or character to follow up on and build on that for the next book. This book left everything hanging. Makes no sense without reading the  second which I probably will not do. i was so disappointed with this story. The characters are not very likable either.

I knew more about the bad guy and his background than the hero who I'm supposed to care about- the auction part needed some back story or reasoning to help justify it- if the H is the commander of the ship, why is he so powerless against the villain who seems to have incurred enough infractions to at least be thrown in the brig",Agree with the other 2/3 star reviewers....,"02 27, 2013",2

A1P7EH9BXW0I4P,Lawrider,"Frustratingly little content in this &#34;episode.&#34;  I have been a fan of this series, the first two books were excellent and fun, book 3 solid.  The author's universe is a little odd, but is filled with Parliamentarians and Royalists feuding in a vacuum created by the departure of the Imperials.Book 4 wasn't particularly good, and now book 5 is decidedly sub-par.  The first 30% of the book is pure filler, there is almost zero plot advancement.  The little admiral incessantly thinks people are out to get him, and the book consists of someone saying something, and then the little admiral obsessing over their 'true' intent.  It is just bad steam of consciousness babble while I wait for something real to happen.  It was fun when he was surprising everyone with his competency in book 1 and 2, but now its tiring to have him be so neurotic.Honestly, if i hadn't read the previous volumes, I would have just put it down and deleted it.  The book begins to get mildly interesting at the halfway mark, and really starts at the 70% mark.  It is there that we actually get small plot advancements.  Even then, it isn't very good.  Apparently Jason cannot send a personal message to Akantha because of some made-up excuse to not lose face?  Ludicrous.  So a medium cruiser advances against two heavy battleships??Then Jason advances into battle against 2 battleships and instead of withdrawing, slugs it out with them?Even the Akantha sublines are getting stupid and tedious.  She has always been a empty cliche, but women rule on Tracto, men fight.  If she is among the star born in a ship, why is she still demanding to run things in combat?  What the hell is the point of being her protector if she ignores him even in battle situations?  She rules, he fights, that is what the author seems to keep telling us about Tracto - so why isn't this happening?  Let alone the fact that based on how other Tracto-ans act, she should have yielded to the ways of the starborn when in their citadels (using the author's language here).Her cruiser gets savaged and then pulls away and sits out the battle until Jason asks her for a spoiling strike?  The medium strike cruiser is designed for long range battle outside of turbo-laser range (according to the author) so why wasn't her cruiser engaged from range after being savaged?  Would not the proper tactic have been to have Jason at close range while her strike cruiser aims for the the engines to disable?Having just completed the book, I feel like the author is just stretching things out and just dumping a bunch of non-plot talk and machinations, and then just putting a little bit of real content at the end to keep the reader willing to pick up the next novel.  I have seen this done in many other series, and frankly it is frustrating.So we are at the end of book 5 and presumably all three battleships are in Jason's hands, Tracto is saved, and now we hear of the Droid tribes.  We get to what is essentially a fresh start.  Too bad it took 5 books to convey what could have been conveyed in three nice volumes.","Little content, lots of filler, and a frustrating read for a fan of this series :/ (contains minor spoilers)","12 9, 2013",2

There are thirty-six stories in under one hundred and ten pages, so things go quickly.  Even when he extends his tales to normal length, you can expect a surprise, but don't expect him to stick around after the climax.  These snappy stories get to the point, and end.Most of the stories (28 out of 36) have been published before in a variety of magazines. The rest are new to this collection. About half of the stories would fall into the Science Fiction category, but others are odd, often ironic, looks into everyday life (though perhaps everyday life for unusual people). The stories are all about the ""twist"", the ending you never expected.  As in any collection, some of the stories are brilliant and some of them fall flat, but overall they will give you something to think about or laugh about.

A2PDVO7DAT73Z0,"Benjamin D. Steele ""marmalade""","The writing feels like an easygoing conversation with an intelligent and well-read friend.The author doesn't offer a careful analysis that considers other viewpoints and counter-arguments. He merely discusses his own idiosyncratic opinions and does so in a pleasant voice. Still, the writing is easy to read and the thoughts expressed easy to follow.Reading this book is as if floating down a mostly broad, meandering, lazy river. It is pleasant and relaxing for much of it, but occasionlly the river narrows, with stronger currents, and it demands one's attention and one's caution. Also, as one is carried along, one becomes curious about all of the landscape that is passing one by.It very much reads like non-fiction written by a fiction writer, in a good sense in many ways, but also in a not-so-good sense. The author is clearly thoughtful and articuate, a refined writer. He has a creative mind which is seen in his style. He is a writer who who shows his enjoyment of writing.What he lacks are the less creative qualities of precision of thought and concision of expression, of analytical rigor and form. He doesn't carefully lay out the premises and evidence for an argument. He is more of a guide and where he is guiding the reader is through the author's own mind, through his thoughts and observations.So, would I recommend this book? It depends on who was asking.Even if you disagree with the author, you could still enjoy reading it as long as you appreciate his style. It is a casual read with deep thoughts to contemplate. In final analysis, though, probably the only reason someone would go out of their way to read this book is if they are already a fan of the author. But if your simply curious, it is more than worth sampling or skimming to see if it interests you.","Decent, Interesting, Not Great","05 21, 2014",3

I thought it was strange that they got such a big part at the beginning and we didn't get to see how or why Payce comes into the picture until chapter 3. However, it does all come together and is important to the story line, so I'm ok with it. Plus I really LOVE Team DD or (Daxien)!!I really need to talk about how Piper Kay writes a sex scene. Ummm HECK YA!! Holy ball-grab sneak attacks, glitter penis and bumping nasties, I was ready to start humping my kindle. When Payce and Brax first touch... it was explosive and perfect! I thought that entire scene was well written and PERFECT. Definitely a 2 finger 1 handed read moment! Actually I could say that about all the sex scenes.There are a lot of funny parts in this little novella and I'm pretty sure most of them are centered around Sparky. Sparky, aka Serge, is my favorite side character. I love his little flaming ass!(Side note: read the Epilogue: Passions Pride) The entire cast is pretty funny but Sparky is really the icing on the cake.Now for some of the things I didn't like. Aaron, why oh why did we have to bring Aaron back? I get it... he is the connection in the story but he didn't really do anything significant except continue to get the crud beat out of him. And the way Brax an Payce were talking about him when they were young, I almost felt sorry for him and wanted him to redeem himself. I thought that the story line was ok but could have been stronger if taken in a different direction.What direction? I have no idea. Maybe someone from prison is trying to kill Brax to get at Payce. Maybe Brax was a witness to a murder and that's why they keep pushing each other away... to protect the other. Hell maybe they need to go on a journey through middle earth to destroy a ring that could end the world as we know it. Then along the way they could meet up with a community of sexy male elves who are masters of pleasure and passion and all they want to do is have awesome orgies and show you how fun kinky is. There can be wizards who create spells that give you crazy multiple orgasms and make you last all night until you pass out... Oh... sorry, I just spaced off in my own little world for a minute.Overall, I really liked it. Piper Kay has a fantastic talent and I love reading whatever she writes. Her stories are good, characters are strong and her sex scenes are amazing!",I know it will be good and I know I can count on some hot ...,"07 13, 2014",4

A284X9LZAOPJ0E,T. Hall,"After the End was difficult to read and yet I finished it and was glad I did.  The first 20% of the book is about the lead character dealing with grief, or not dealing with grief, I guess. After two years, Quinn seems to be immersed in the tomb with Aaron in a way that is very uncomfortable.  His two BFFs, a lesbian couple, compel him into a blind date with the delectable Brady. Like most of the reviewers imply, Brady was the more engaging character, though Quinn picked up points by half way through the story and was a good and interesting person by the end - a much better and more complete character.  But I can't figure out why Brady bothered.  There is something missing in Brady's character development that would help us understand his growing affection for Quinn.An author who opens with grief and works it into an uplifting story is taking a huge risk.  Nearly half the book is spent getting past Quinn's grief and making him into a functional character.  If we hadn't been introduced and charmed by Brady, I can't imagine this book as anything other than a memorial to the pain of grief.  And that really bothered me.  But Brady is there and he does change the life and energy of the story.  Kidwell put herself out there to deal with a difficult problem and managed to turn the book into something good.The MM aspect didn't work, for me.  This could just as easily have been the story of a het couple and I think male readers will be disappointed.  Few women writers seem to get the rawer aspects of male relationships - Eden Winters and RJ Scott come to mind.I'm left feeling ambivalent about the book: the writing style is excellent, the story moves quite well even if depressingly through the first 1/4 of the book, the character development of the leads has gaps.  I recommend it but hesitate to give it high marks because of the beginning and the MM relationship. If you have dealt with the loss of someone very close to you, getting through the first (large) section is going to be difficult.  If you're looking for a satisfying MM romantic and sexual read, this book misses.","After the End is well written, emotionally draining and MM irrelevant","02 10, 2013",3
AKF1XBBWAQR6L,Star Stingy! AKA Mrs. M.,"I really liked Inky, but didn't love this.  First of all Inky became Anika in this book... And I assume that's not just a more mature name- but encapsulates the emotional transformation she encounters. But to tell you the truth Inky was a bad A$$. Therefore, as nice as it was she found her HEA- I missed the balls-out gal.Villain ""Joe"" never really made sense to me. The whole kidnapping & return was just bizarre and pretty anti-clamtatic. The whole rescue scene in the boat left me confused. Why would they let Serena go anywhere with him for 2 weeks knowing what a monster he was?  Then the follow up at the hotel w him and David's fingers. It was all just a cluster that I didn't feel was told very clearly. I never really felt closure on that issue??Cole was just a little too ""creepster"" for me. I can't put him in my best book BF category.  I was happy to have read it.  Assume there will be more books with Nico & Larks story. Maybe for David too?  But I'm not planning on continuing with this series if it does in fact continue.",2.75 stars.

A11C7D7FWRMLUN,Amazon Customer,"This book had elements that were right up my alley: coming of age, first person point of view, 1 main character, and an interesting storyline with super powers! Where it fails is the delivery, character development, and the relationships between the characters.  Everything is so superficial that you will find it lacking with no depth in any of the characters. Most if not all of the characters are 2 dimensional and you find yourself not caring much about them.Very dramatic things happen to the main character and his friends but there is barely any reaction from him or his so-called close friends.  Being ripped away from the only home he knew for 15 years (sure no problem), dropped into a completely different culture (okay), meeting his long lost relative that he thought dead (great), finding out he has to kill people to survive (I can do it), actually killing people for the first time (got it handled), close people dying around him or being betrayed multiple times (story must go on so I don't have time to bat an eyelash), etc. and etc. I'm being facetious but the point is the characters barely grow and none of these dramatic events even registers.  Even though it is in first person it's like reading what is happening devoid of emotions; you would think the main character would react with some sort of strong emotion.  All of this is a detriment because at a certain point you care less as to what happens to any of the characters.There were some action parts and that is pretty much the only thing going for this book.  Everything else is pretty much sub-par, including plot holes big enough to drive a tank through.  I think this is the Authors first book so hopefully he'll add more character development in the next installment or more action.The book is free though so the author should be commended for allowing readers a chance to see if this is their cup of tea.  It wasn't mine but it could be yours; happy reading to everyone!",Little character develpment and superficial relationships between characters,"10 3, 2012",2

I very rarely write negative reviews, especially not of free books, and ESPECIALLY not of memoirs.  I feel like giving a negative review of a memoir is almost like putting someone down.  However, this Santa doesn't seem to mind judging people and putting them down, so I'm sure he won't mind if I do the same.  When I saw that this was free on Amazon I was excited - I love memoirs and it's perfect for Christmas.  From the very beginning I could tell this guy was WAY into being Santa, and he felt like he was VERY important and knowledgeable.  And apparently, he was the world's most perfect dad, judging from the way he criticizes others.  Not only that, his views on parenting are very wishy washy.  At times, he wishes to punch parents for yelling at their children, but then he will tell another story about how the parents need to get their child under control for acting so badly.  He judges people without knowing anything about him.  He judges children, parents, fat people, pregnant teens (who were over 18), even different races.  He told a ""story"" (really wasn't a story at all) about an African-American couple who brought their children to see Santa and they were very pleasant people, in his words ""Mom and Dad looked adoringly at their enthusiastic children, both with broad smiles. This visit was all they expected it to be - an opportunity for their children to be loved and listened to by Santa.  It was an integral part of their Christmas.""  Uhhh what???  Is it shocking to this Santa that black people celebrate Christmas and are okay with taking their children to see Santa even though he's - OMG - white???  Apparently it is - he goes on to say that it JUST NOW occurs to him that ""there is no prejudice where Santa is concerned."" Then he says that skin color has nothing to so with it.  Okay, so hold on.  Basically he is assuming that these people had prejudices but put them aside for Santa Claus??  I can't even believe what I am reading.  I think this guy might still live in 1950.  Another time, he actually says that he thought this group of adults in line to see him looked normal, and wouldn't have known they were mentally disabled if he hadn't spoken to them!  So now they aren't normal because they are disabled?I could name at least 50 ""stories"" (it reads more like a list of what kind of people he had to deal with that day) from this book that were judgmental, but I am already getting quite irritated just after having listed those.  Also I think that he believes he is the real Santa Claus, and that he is the best Santa Claus.  Even in the book description above he wrote that he didn't think anyone else could have written this book. He believes that he alone is the reason people have Christmas cheer and that he changes everyone's life that comes to see him or waves at him in the mall.  He is obsessed with the real St. Nick and how skinny both he and St. Nick are.  So yeah I'm done with this book.  I got it for free and I would certainly not recommend paying even $1 for this.","Hypocritical, Judgemental, Self-important Santa","12 12, 2012",1

A2U1WH1E5O5DZI,Robert J. Robinson,"I enjoyed the first book in this series, but found myself increasingly turned off by the gratuitously right-wing and jingoistic ideology in this second volume.  Terms like &#34;gun control nuts&#34; are blithely thrown around, and sneering references to liberals, feminists, and anyone who questions US military hegemony permeate the story-telling.  Not to mention massively insulting accounts of &#34;Arabs&#34; and their culture.  There is no reason for this:  This should be a politics free tale of human resistance in the face of alien invasion, but the author's real agenda:  To provide a heavy-handed parable of the rightness of the conservative, gun-bearing, god-fearing, nationalistic Americans against the forces of godless secularism that would question this world view.

AURG7YLW3JLDF,"Robert L. Arend ""The Robert""","First disclaimer: I am not a fan of the shape-shifting werewolf genre, but I purchased this story because it popped up on my Facebook Newsfeed. I liked the cover, and have only a faint online forum's association with author Melissa Snark--causing me to want to read ""The Child Thief"" only out of curiosity of her ability to write at least competent fiction. I have never written a review of any short story, novella or novel if--no matter how good the plot--it proved to be poorly written. If I can't honestly recommend a work of fiction on Amazon, I will not write a review for that work.  Period.That said, though ""The Child Thief"" didn't make me any fonder of the genre, I give a four star recommendation to those who enjoy this kind of story: because it is well-written, well-plotted and the characters well-developed.

I almost always finish a book just because I paid for it.A few of the issues I did not like was how immediately they were both attracted to each other and couldn't stop thinking about each other.  Another was how the author tried to portray Leanna as a free spirit and spontaneous.  Seriously in one scene she had jam handprints on her shorts.  She's almost thirty and doesn't have the common sense not to wipe her hands on her shorts.  When she tried to sweep the sand off his porch, she was not able to handle the broom and slung sand up on his chair.  Oh, my favorite one.  She was so free spirited that she turned around and  took her shirt off two minutes after meeting him to change into a sweatshirt.  Two thoughts before taking her shirt off she had wondered if she was in danger.  Ridiculous!This book was so elementary, I could not even pretend to enjoy it.  Oh yes, one can't forget that Kurt, a person that is a recluse and OCD, thought she was cute and did a 180 after knowing Leanna for two days.Oh yes, the first sex scene on the beach was weak and the dog watched.

A1JKVE4B85R2UB,Wilmaran,"This is the first book I've read from this author. I look forward to discovering the works of different authors and their genre.When I read the preview of this book I was so excited. I love the good old fashion drama in a romance novel without someoneon the run for their life or needing body guards because someone wants them dead!  The characters were strong and believable.Fell in love with Tyson. He was a strong alpha male confident enough to show compassion and empathy. Gabrielle was youngwith the low self esteem you would naturaly see in an abused woman. Even Dilvan being the misunderstood spoiled abuserwas spot on. A great job was done building all the characters in order for us to be able to relate to them. I enjoyed this bookfrom the moment I started to read. Couldn't put it down from start to finish. Absolutely loved all the POVs. I love reading whatthe characters are thinking about and have to say!!! That being said peeps if you're like me and need a HEA this is not the bookfor you.

I loved the notion of Kara having endured so much pleasure before she finally had her fill of both men, which was the best, hottest finish.I have been intrigued by this...When Sam is holding the mirror, her body in the ropes, and she stares at herself then Logan comes up behind and with `one gentle tug and she comes around where those knots are placed.' I loved how it was written... `My pussy convulsed in a spasmodic fit; the knot pressing at my An#s  doubled my satisfaction as my ring clenched rhythmically.' I imagine what it would be like with ropes or the thrill of it all and could really feel the author's words.At the end, after the oil - it's written... `I felt him nudge against my welcoming back door - until their orgasmic assault.'

A247H7GBQ6Y25O,alex r.,"[I was given this ARC for an honest review]Read more reviews at [...]Remember the Moon is a book I might not have originally picked up to read, but it was a book that I am so glad I was given the opportunity to. It was much different than what I normally read, and different from what I even expected, but loved it.Remember the Moon was touching and intriguing, and to be honest, melted my heart. The story toys back at forth with the paranormal after the death of Maya&#8217;s husband, Jay, in a car accident. The story shows how it effects the family, including their 7 year old son, Calder. The story is surely tragic in the beginning but does blossom into something beautiful through the paranormal reaching out that Jay does in the afterlife, and Maya&#8217;s coping. It isn't a turbulent road, but it's a journey worth keeping up with.While the book is written from only two perspectives, that of the deceased Jay, and the grieving Maya, I loved the dynamics of trying to understand what both were going through and trying to gain and accept, both Jay in death, and Maya with being a widow. I especially felt for Maya who had trouble battling her grief and moving on, particularly in a romantic way. I mean, who wouldn&#8217;t? I can't imagine what that would be like! The journey here that Maya took wasn't one I expected either when combined with her deceased husband watching from the afterlife, but the journey the two take to get over the obstacles from jealousy, to misguided fate, to then conclude with an understanding of what's right and wrong to feel, I just loved the ride the author took me on.The way Jay tries to reach out from the other side is heartwarming and heartbreaking all at the same time. This is were confusion, jealousy and acceptance also comes in on his part. To be honest I enjoyed it so much I don't want to ruin the details. I enjoyed this dynamic of the book so much that I got hear his side.Jay also reaches out to Calder through dreams when life seems to get a bit chaotic for the kid, and he tries to get through to his wife through her art (which used to be an outlet for before his death) and during psychic appointments. Sometimes I just wanted to hug them both. Calder goes a bit off the deep end with his fathers death and the fact Jay aches to make it right. I felt it. What parent wouldn't want to help their child through such a thing?You might want to keep a box of tissues with you, but don&#8217;t worry, you&#8217;ll be doing a lot of happy smiling too, and maybe even some frustrated nail biting. But it's important to note that this book isn't short of wit and giggles too! The author definitely weaves an authentic web of, just *sigh* everything!The reason why this story hit me so hard is because it&#8217;s the reality that any of this can happen to anyone, the whole losing a loved one thing.It was heartfelt, thoughtful and above anything, raw in a fantastic way.

A3INL3IB0KS081,myjunk,"I read this book yesterday (rather short) and the more I think about it, the more I realize that it really wasn't that good of a book. The story line was ok, it just felt rushed and choppy, nothing really seemed to flow - even the romance seemed rushed.  To me, there was never any feelings of ""true feelings"" between Meg and Joey, to the point that I began to wonder if she was under some sort of spell.I really don't like starting a book and not finishing it and now that I am finished, I feel like I forced myself to read to the end.  This is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 star.I got the book a couple of months ago while it was free and I am thankful for that.  I wouldn't have even wanted to spend a dime on it.  I honestly can't believe it has so my stars.  Guess each reader has their own likes and tastes, but for me I really didn't care that much for this book.

AJ6NMC9P07O5S,Chick,"What I love about Eva and Deuce's story is that the story does not happen in flashbacks. This story was mostly reminiscing about past interactions. I wish she would have told the story from the beginning and moved forward. I hated that the moments between Dorothy and Hawk were few and far between, then, when they get their happily ever after, it's abruptly over and the epilogue is not even about them, it is a setup for Undying. After everything Dorothy has been through, she deserved more, a book dedicated to her romance.I cried like an idiot in many parts especially in the clubhouse when Hawk was saying goodbye, can't say more than that. Hawk is amazing and a wonderful man. Despite what ZZ has done, we should not forget his love for Danny, how he brought her out of her sorrow and how she mistreated him. ZZ deserves his HEA. I don't know how the author is going to do that. Is Devin going to get his HEA?I still love Madeline Sheehan and will probably purchase her next books in this series despite my disappointment in this book.

I hoped that she would improve in her craft and bring her writing up to par with the level of promise the characterizations and plot had promised.  I should have known better by her disposition and response to my review for the first book.To be fair with this review (as I was in the review of the first book), I will let readers know that I only read the first chapter of Cascade Preppers (for the first book I read over 50% of the novel).  As for the GSP... spelling has greatly improved, but the grammar and punctuation, while not as bad as the several edited (and I use the word 'edited', loosely) versions of the first book, it is still lacking.  Not what I expect and demand from a novel that I would purchase.I had hoped it would be tolerable enough for me to continue on to find out what happens to the great characters Ms. Shaw has created, but it is not.  Great characters and an interesting plot are only a few of the building blocks of a successful (or readable) story.  I found Graham's internalized misogyny, as evidenced by this quote, to be disturbing:&#8220;Tala had proven herself to be level headed, more so than most of the women Graham had ever encountered.&#8221;It was the 'had ever encountered' bit that got my inner feminist screaming for blood and realizing that instead of the structure of her writing rising to the level of the characters and plot, that the characters were diving to meet the sub-par writing standard.I will not give Ms. Shaw another chance and for those that demand a certain standard of writing, I doubt this series is for you.

ARP7RFS0DPP8P,eBook Addict,"This appears to be a first effort from a very young author - and it shows. The premise is good, if overdone (good girl matched up with bad boy in science class); however, the execution is wanting. There are way too many spelling errors for those of us who care. (When are all these e-book authors going to realise that spell-check does not an editor make?) As for the style of writing, it's probably better targeted to people under 13 years or those who wish they still were.The heroine, Katy, flounces (yes, literally) her way through the novel - she slams down pens, yells out loud in class (sometimes even without any repercussion) and stomps her feet when things don't go her way. Frankly, she's having a bit of a bad time and she's not handling it particularly well.The hero is not very well represented. He is sort of there, but mostly not. Consequently, it's hard to feel anything too much for him, though he does seem to get the best of the dialogue when he does manage some interaction; having said this, it's nowhere near as clever as some others have suggested. Speaking of which (pardon the pun), the dialogue is, as another reviewer noted, very stilted and quite unrealistic. Again, I believe this is the consequence of a very young writer.Overall, it's not a shocking effort, but it really could be improved. Hopefully, the author will take time to perfect her craft (by starting with being way more careful with spelling and working on producing realistic dialogue), so that we will see better efforts from her in the future.","Not the worst, but really not good.","01 31, 2013",2

Up to that point, there is a meandering story about a lady, her sister and their mom, all witches. Eventually the ideal boyfriend is introduced, complete with fantasy shopping, makeover, hot sex and outrageously expensive date. The focus though is on the witches.[I consider the next paragraph a warning instead of a spoiler, but a comment disagreed.)Then the leading lady looses her morals and inexplicably becomes the sort of woman who says she loves one man one day, meaning it, he is the only guy for her, then then lies to him about where she is going a week later, goes to guy #2's bedroom, puts up token resistance, has sex with him, and a while later is telling him that she loves him best. Guy #1 barely appears in the rest of the story but inexplicably still loves her. Gag me with a spoon, I wanted to vomit. Wise women don't put themselves in such situations where they will be tempted to make bad choices. She will obviously be having affairs with numerous guys her whole life, and the idiot guys believe her lies of love & faithfulness. Her professions of love are worth a dirty hankie.The 2nd story leading lady spend most of her time complaining about her boss, and has a long standing affair with a married man. She dates him for one year after learning he is married, only dumps him when she gets bored. Disgusting. Accidentally contributes to her boss dying and is way too stupid to dial 911, even though she is standing right next to a phone. If she or someone else had performed CPR, the boss would very likely have lived. So, here is another example of her poor morals: she would rather let her boss die than get him medical aid. Lackluster romance eventually develops, complete with ridiculously rich boyfriend.The 3rd story leading lady loves insulting everyone, particularly customers, and blaming other people for her problems.

A2UQQHPC7BO0,Read-aholic,"This is my least favorite of the three books I have read in this series. The beginning of the book fails to let the reader know why Alice is called Replacement. It fails to tie the previous books together. Aunt Haddie, Jack's mother Patty, his deceased father Steven and his foster brother Chandler are hardly mentioned, if at all. These are characters that those of us who have read the previous books have come to know. If you have not read the first two book in this series, you will not completely understand the relationship between Jack and Alice aka Replacement. I was confused that Replacement would take such a 180 turn and try to slow down the budding relationship with Jack. In the previous two books, she was pushing hard for intimacy. In this one, she wants to be &#34;established&#34; before committing to the relationship.While I loved that Jack was a cop who followed his intuition in the previous books, this time he really crosses the line. We are supposed to believe that one man can figure out who the kidnapper is, and where the kidnap victim is, essentially all by himself. He can outsmart the mob and the Japanese mob. He is smarter than the sheriff's department and the FBI. He does not cooperate with those agencies at all and ends up suspended.

ASGZR1C9HLVSM,Ronald Stepp,"I am slowly beginning to really dislike the author. Every single time someone says something, he leaves out the comma,examples (POSSIBLE SPOILERS):""Yes, it was the flu,"" confirmed Ariel nodding her head slightly in acknowledgment.""An evacuation fleet,"" Colonel Greene repeated his head creasing in a frown.""It was my fault the door shut,"" confessed Ariel nodding at Greg.""An AI?"" gasped Lisa walking toward the screen to take a closer look.I mean, the author seems to almost have it in his head that this is the correct grammatical way to structure people talking. I can tell you it's definitely starting to annoy me. Along with the fact that every character seems to have learned to talk the exact same way, and without any ugly nasty evil contractions that might make them seem more human.God I hope he gets better, I'm seriously considering whether to buy any more of these stories. They're not TOO bad, though with the way the author tends to repeat stuff in a paragraph, example: flight bay, let's make sure we mention it 5 or 6 times in the same paragraph. Or use the same long word at the beginning and then again at the end of the paragraph instead of indirectly referring to it. How stupid does the author think I am? I think he can safely assume I'll know what he is talking about it 20 words later without explicitly referring to it again.Anybody know if he gets better? Is it worth it to buy any more of these?PS I am 65% of the way through this one and wondered what I missed, the characters constantly say how AMAZED they are at the advanced alien technologies, yet up to this point, all we have seen that may be advanced is the AI, but the AI hasn't really impressed me all that much, all the advanced tech they have discovered are hatches, hallways, hatch handles, stairways, and ..... wait.. that's it?  What the heck is so amazing about this, so amazing in fact, that the character wonders whether his future sons will fly in one of ""these wondrous spaceships.""  Yeah, one of the ones that crashed all over the moon.

""We can launch the shuttle through the open door. There will be two feet of clearance on both sides.""""Two feet!"" Moaned Greg turning pale. ""Is that safe?""This theme occurs regularly throughout the two books I have read so far. A lightbulb blows out, and they act like a battle fleet of cannibal aliens just appeared out of deep space.To the author, your depiction of the kinds of people that become astronauts is so clueless, I wonder if you have ever seen documentaries of the space program, or even the Apollo movie with Tom Hanks,  Watch it. Two feet of clearance on either side of their vehicle while trying to take off may not be as safe as pulling your car out of the driveway at home, but that portrayal just makes me want to throw up. I'm surprised you don't have Jason holding Greg's hand for the takeoff.

A2ON53GR80JS8S,"Justirishgirl ""aut viam inveniam aut faciam""","The problem with reading a book by a good writer, like Lynda Chance is that you compare it to her other books. I loved some of her other books like Josh & Hannah and Marcos Redemption. This book was ok.  The author still has the elements I love in her books.  Hero is ultra possessive and jealous.  He is a player until he meets the h.  Then he sees no other.  Her heroes are always faithful and her books are HEA.  These things I cannot get enough of which this book included.  Also there was hot s_x.  Hence the book received stars for including those things.The problem is with this book, other than those things listed above, it did nothing for me.  I could take it or leave it.  I will read more of Lynda Chance's books as long as they contain those elements.  I am looking forward to Redwood Falls, #2, which is apparently coming out soon.  I  read Temptation in Texas: Logan and Lauren when it first came out and liked it.  It is different because the couple is already married 5 years when the book stars up.  You get to see more of possessive jealous, dominant crazy in love Logan.

A1CIEZNXXDSO6V,Emeryl Tekutsu,"Since this is a book written for children, I thought I should include some input from children.First, I read this book with my three year old niece. She enjoyed the pictures, particularly the ones where the kitten was hiding.She had this to say:""Did you like that book?"" ""That was a good book.""""Isn't that cat orange like your cat?"" ""Yeah.""""Does your cat like to pounce like the cat in the book?"" ""No. He hides under my bed.""Although she knows how to read maybe 30 words, the words used in this book were mostly ones she didn't know.Later I read this with my five year old nephew. He liked the book as well. He could read most of the words.Three things I did notice that could be fixed: At one point the book uses ""alot"" when it should be ""a lot"". Another small issue is that sometimes the white text would go over a light color and would be harder to read. Having a stroke around the text to make it stand out more in those situations might help. The book also re-uses a few of the images, although that wasn't a big deal.The pictures are very simplistic but cute.

A185AUSUUAH46K,Lisa@2bookaholics,"Let me start off by saying I am 100 percent addicted to this series.  I want to go all fan girl on CL and give her a big hug and kiss on the cheek for giving me something so different from the norm.  These books are different. The direction they are heading is different and even though I wasn't so sure about it she's given me a reason to want to follow it through.In this book Sang and her sister are on there own, crazy mom is in a hospital and the father has abandoned them both.  Each one of these books has had an underlying theme and in this one it's trust.  Sang must learn to trust the boys with everything and it's not an easy thing to do.  She wants into the Academy.  She thinks once she's in she will understand the boys better and feel like she is truly a part of this family they keep telling her she is in.  The thing is she's got it backward.  This group really is ""Family First Academy Second""  There is also more of an underlying current of romance in this book then in the other three.  Each of the boys is ready to move Sang into dating but the order says she's got to make the move.  Each boy has his own unique way of showing Sang what she means to them and the Author makes some of the most innocent touches so much more  My heart pounded sure he would kiss me.  I waited. Only he didn't he did something unexpected and better.  His nose traced over the side of my nose, across my cheek. Hovering right there. So Close. Where his nose trailed, my heart followed.  Each one of the boys is something different to her but equally as important.  Kota, ""The boss."" North, ""The fierce, ever vigilant watchman.""  Mr.Blackbourne ""Of all the boys in the group, I never imagined Mr. Blackbourne being the one to understand me so well. Someone I could trust to talk to me, to tell me the answers.""This book was more about establishing the perimeters of the relationships between the  characters. Not only teaching Sang to continue to open up and trust the boys but that they too needed to trust her abilities and her judgment. Even if that meant arguing or yelling.  ""Yes. You had the right idea. You need to continue to argue back.  Listen to that he has to say and if you disagree, speak up and say so,  He'll listen."" He yell's to show he cares about you.""  ""What if he doesn't care?""  ""He won't talk to you."" I think that is a hard lesson for anyone to learn even outside of a book.  Just because I disagree with someone doesn't mean I don't like them or care for them.  Actually it's the opposite.  If I didn't care I wouldn't bother.There is still so much to figure out and I am looking forward to the next books in the series. I love that she mixes the mystery of  The Academy with the dynamics of the relationships.  Sang is still a target at school and it isn't just from the students anymore.  I have enjoyed seeing each of the characters. especially Sang evolve into a someone I can feel for.  See that's the deciding factor for me with a book.  I want to be invested in the characters by the time I'm done. I want to crave the rest of the story.  I want to be excited because the Author hasn't shown her entire hand yet. and This series delivers all of that and a little something extra.  I have always had my heart set on North, call me biased but I love the guys who are rough around the edges and a little bit harder to get close to but that have that larger than life heart on the inside.  Heck I married one! However as this series continues I find that like Sang I can see something I love about each one.  I get the mixed up feelings and the way she can't let any of them go. It's not like a triangle where your loyalties are divided. It's like all of them make a whole. That it wouldn't work right without the others just like any other family.  The fact that they are all smokin hot doesn't hurt either.  Again I say start at the beginning if you haven't read the first 3 books go get em, do it now!

A3IWSERO1UIB9N,Ginny Lurcock,"There was a long-held fear among the known races of the galaxy that no matter how powerful or technologically advanced they became, there would always be someone stronger--hiding far out in the deep recesses of the cosmos.That fear has now been realized.A destructive alien armada has arrived, triggering a brutal war that will change the galaxy forever.The only hope for survival rests with two, mortal adversaries--who must rise above their mutual hatred to work together on a dangerous mission. One is a lethal assassin unleashed on an unsuspecting enemy--a man so dangerous that even his own government wants him dead. The other, a ruthless alien invader with his own shocking agenda.With enemies on both sides of the conflict, the assassin undergoes a personal revelation, striking at the very core of who and what he is. But will this epiphany lead to the salvation of the galaxy?Or assure its destruction...INSERT COVER IMAGEWhen I signed Bad Blood up for Story Cartel, I had this brief moment of ""I wonder what the Story Cartel experience is like for a reader..."" And by brief moment I mean brief moment, because no sooner had I thought it then I turned around and downloaded a book.This book, actually.And then I felt sort of ambivalent...See, the thing is, when you first open the book many of the sentences start with the word I.  It's all ""I did this..."" and ""I did that..."" and ""holy crapballs what did I get myself into...""But I rarely if ever give up on reading books, and this time there was a story to be told (that might even help me out in the long run) so I stuck with it.Now I don't actually know if many of the sentences continued to start with the word I, because by chapter four I sort of stopped caring.(I just scanned back through, there's less I-ing.  Which is now a thing.  Because I said so.)What happens in chapter four, you ask?  Well, for starters, the monks show up.  And that, my friends, is when sh*t gets real.  I cannot tell you why, since it would spoil some of the surprise, but let me just say that things are pretty awesome in the world that Mr. Vann created.  Okay, one thing is pretty awesome.The rest is actually kind of sh*tty.See, there is this race (the Brenin) trying to take over the known galaxy.  And not only are the other races seemingly unable to work together to get them to back off, but the hostile race has these super shields that makes them almost invincible.But the Udek (this race of super aggressive dick bags) have  a plan.  One that kind of gets muddled rather quickly.  Leaving Tien (an Udek) in a position where he's forced to work with a Brenin.  Something neither one is very happy about, which only leads to more awesome.Plus the way these two have to work together... BRILLIANT.Oh, and then they help this third race, the Obas.Which, I might add, is the only point of the story where I went ""oh really.""  Not because it didn't make sense, but because Tien was all ""we have to help them"" and I was all ""really, you just have to?  Couldn't possibly get around it?""  *rolls eyes*I got over it quickly though because the Obas homeworld, the race in general and Boe in specific made me geek out....Don't judge me.  Water worlds are badass.(I'm trying a new thing in my reviews, so please bear with me.  I haven't worked out the transition from up there to down here...)Idea:  I really liked the idea behind this story.  I mean, I like science fiction so that's kind of a given, but beyond the ships and races there are trying to snuff each other out there's two really interesting concepts that it's killing me not to be able to share with you.  KILLING ME.Execution: Aside from the I-ing at the beginning and that one ""you just had to help"" it was well executed.  Fast paced and easy to follow.Content Level:  Some graphic violence along with the description of how a character had been tortured off screen.Genre:  Space-tastic Science Fiction with new races and space ships and space ships that do battle.Solid idea, good execution, and I found myself going ""is there going to be a sequel?""  Which is always a good sign.  Also, I have no idea since it wasn't clearly marked on goodreads and my headache prevented me from searching further than that.4 StarsA free copy of this book was provided by Story Cartel in exchange for a fair and honest review.",4 stars,"09 19, 2013",4

It is sorta slow at first but it picks up to leave you hanging and wanting more just like the leading lady. I am looking forward to reading more of this series. While this part was kind of tame to start the ending shows real promise for the other parts in the series to pick up and keep you hot and bothered to the last page of the last book in the series.This is not one you want your young children reading for a bedtime story but it is one to hand over to your partner to give him or her some ideas. Celine is every man's dream woman while Dunn is what many women want in a man..strong, take charge, rich and handsome. This may seem a little bit cliche and not a bit realistic to some but it adds something to the illusion and lure of this genre.I also love that at the end of the book she offers her readers what she calls beta reading.

A1OAF99ATB1RRG,0527,"This has got to be one of the most extraordinary bedtime books for children ages 3 to 8 ever! The book is colorful, eye catching, and well illustrated. The little girl named Mia on the front cover absolutely caught my eye from the first time I saw the book. Her beautiful eyes and bright red hair captivates readers and the creativity and style of the way the book is written is quite amazing. The book is exciting without a boring moment.The book tells a clear story with rhyming words to help children understand and learn better. The story even sends a message to parents that may be reading to their children. Facing fears is something that we all have done at least once in our life. The book teaches courage and definitely focuses on how obstacles can be overcome through the mind of a child. The book would make a great gift idea and is something that I highly recommend purchasing.Vickie SheffieldChild Daycare Provider",One of the Greatest Bedtime Stories Ever!,"11 13, 2013",5
A2OJ6HPMK67BGQ,"Julie ""Manga Maniac Cafe""","Review:I have come to really like Entangled's Ever After line.  There are times when I want a shorter read, and after reading many titles from this imprint, it's become one of my favorites.  Kiss the Bride is a little longer than some of the other offerings in the Ever After line-up, clocking in at a little over 140 pages.  This was a fun read, too, with the perspective mainly told from Heck's eyes.  Heck can be a self-righteous snot, especially near the end of the story, but he is an entertaining character, and his point of view kept me turning the pages.  How he did not realize he was in love with his best buddy is a bit beyond me, but I guess realizing that Caro was the woman for him late was better than never.  Thirty-four years late, but who beside Caro is keeping track of that anyway?Heck has been best friends with Caro for his entire life.  When she agrees to marry Dan, her boyfriend for the last three years, he's lassoed into being the maid of honor.  He thinks Dan is a pencil neck, and wants to kick his ass more often than not, but agrees to help Caro with her wedding.  He is leery that she and Dan are rushing the ceremony, and wonders why Dan is never around.  He hasn't lifted one finger to assist with the wedding arrangements, but as long as Caroline is happy, Heck's not going to say anything. Much.For her part, Caroline has only agreed to marry Dan to get on with her life.  She's been in love with Heck for years, but he sees her as a sister.  He's not physically attracted to her, and for fear of ruining their friendship, Caro stays silent about her feelings for him.  She's not going to jeopardize their relationship by spilling her guts to him.  What she does want, though, is a family, and after going out with Dan for years, she decides that, while he's not Heck, he will have to do.  Her clock is ticking away, and she doesn't have time to waste on a guy who doesn't even realize that she's a girl.  She likes Dan well enough, and they have similar goals in life, so they should have a comfortable married life, if nothing else.When Heck is helping Caro pick out dresses for the wedding, he suddenly realizes that she possesses a pair of ta-tas.  A large pair of ta-tas at that.  Suddenly, he can't stop thinking about what's under her dress.  He keeps having very un-friend like thoughts about her.  He is consumed with thoughts of getting her naked.  Uh-oh.  He can't be having thoughts like this, not when Caro is getting married on Saturday! To the pinhead.I think I what enjoyed most about this story  is the compressed time-line.  It starts at the dress shop, where Heck has his big revelation about Caro's boobs, jumps to the bachelorette party he's planned on Friday night, and wraps up on Saturday, the wedding day.  This is a romance on Red Bull.  It's quick, it's funny, and it's a diverting read.  Both Heck and Caro have trust issues, and while it's sad that they don't trust each other, they eventually find the courage to admit their feelings.  It's almost too late for both of them by the time they do, and I was pretty disappointed with Heck at first, but his run in with the law convinced me that his feelings were real.  If you've got some free time, sitting down with Kiss the Bride would be an entertaining use of your time.Grade:  B",Great beach read,"08 5, 2013",4

A1ENRQF4GLY4O2,Bill Nelson,"My son has four favorite authors: Dr. Seuss, Bill Peet, Bob Staake and Peter Collier. We go through books at an incredible rate so even though he is only five, he knows a good book when he hears it. I agree with him on his taste in authors because his favorites don't just hold his interest but they entertain his parents as well. Out of all those authors, his ""current"" favorite book was Collier'sTHE GARDEN PARTY (rhyming, bedtime, reading, children, kids, short, stories Stories). But now, that has been dethroned by Collier's latest effort, LOU and STU! This book is so fun and amusing, and a really great story. I can imagine the author spending months agonizing over each word choice to make them rhyme perfectly while also telling an interesting story and keeping the pages moving. This tale of the two twin brothers is suspenseful, full of lessons, funny and it rhymes! In the end their feud, which now involves an entire town, comes down to a single baseball game and we're served a clever surprise ending. Writing great kids book is hard, Collier makes it look easy and deserves his place among my son's favorites. That's why we own all twenty-one of his books. And, all of them, like Lou and Stu are highly recommended. 5-stars",Fantastic story and it rhymes!,"12 13, 2013",5

A1DU1CJEP60TLQ,Pamela,"There were parts of the novel that I enjoyed, and parts that didn't appeal to me. I also thought it was a little too long. A good balance of intrigue, romance, and humour thanks to some of the witty dialogue. I liked the two protagonists, Chris and Hayley, and all their friends, Tex, Caleb, Doc, Easy, and Hawk. I really appreciated the author refraining from the mainstream whereby the couple meet, have sex right away, and then move in together. Instead, Chris and Hayley's relationship grows over time, first from landlord-tenant, to friendship, and lastly to lovers. The patience that Chris showed Hayley when it came to them being romantically involved was impressive to say the least. I should mention that Chris and his friends are definitely alpha-males; and at times so over-the-top alpha which I'm not a huge fan of. I actually found the men went back and forth between being an alpha-male and a regular, decent guy. The one thing I found a little odd were the deep conversations the men would have as a group talking about relationships, and their sexual preferences. Every time Chris screwed up, they'd have this deep conversation about his actions, what he should've done or not done. All of this made it difficult at times to remember that this is a group of men who are mechanics, have done tours in the Middle East, and ride motorcycles. As for Hayley, while I did like her character, I thought the author went a little overboard making her a little too sweet, too goody-goody, someone who is so smart, witty, sassy and can do no wrong. A little too much for me. In the end, it's still a pretty good read.",Pretty Good,"11 21, 2013",3
A1VME3FLHEV6DP,Debbie,"I've read the first two in the series and they were enjoyable reads, so I of course want to continue the series. While this one seemed like it was going to also be a good read, I ended up not very impressed with it at all.I really tried to like this mail order bride and while I could understand her deceit and reasons in the beginning, I felt she would redeem herself once she got to Montana. Instead she not only married a really great, honest and caring guy, Gideon, she went into her marriage with so many lies! The worst of course was marrying him under her best friends name (which by law would make the marriage invalid, even back in those days) and continued her previous lies while building on them the whole time. It was just very hard for me to like a person who would lie so much and repeatedly to a man who believed very strongly in honesty and working through things. He'd also given her so many chances to be honest with him, since he knew that she was keeping something from him but she always found some reason not to be honest and while bits and pieces slowly came to light, she still kept the biggest secrets and lies to herself all in the name of her deep love for him.Personally, I don't know how you can lie so well to someone who treats you so well when you supposedly love them so much. It was just a real turn off for me and I just couldn't connect, respect or like the. character of Elenor/Addie.  She betrayed her best friend and deceived so many people for months that she just wasn't redeemable for me because it didn't seem to matter who she lied to, manipulated or deceived to get what she wanted. Sure, there were times it seemed it was really weighing on her conscious but obviously not enough to be honest to even one person; she would just twist the truth to cover up for things she got caught at with a pitying sob story and deceived so many good people that she just wasn't redeemable for me. Throughout, I saw her as a very selfish, lieing person, who never considered consequences of her deceptions on others lives or feelings except to herself if she got caught.One other thing in this book that was a big turn off to me was the blatant criticism of another's religion. Though I'm no longer a church goer, I grew up as a Christian and still have a very strong faith and belief in my religion. While I'm not into the exceptionally religious romances that I believe go overboard, I have no problem with storylines of people and their faith. What truly shocked me in this book, was what I felt was a totally unnecessary part where there is much criticism as well as joking made about the Catholic religion.  While I may not agree with other religious beliefs,  I at least try and show the respect for others as I hope they would for mine. I personally felt it was very unnecessary to the storyline in the first place but since religion was brought up, I definitely didn't expect the derogatory remarks and for me, I would find some of the things said very insulting if I were Catholic, totally unnecessary and uncalled for. Was a big turn off for me, definitely not something I'd expect from a true Christian. Very tacky and demeaning.Unfortunately, this just wasn't a book I can see myself recommending which is a disappointment since the first two in the series were rather good. It also makes me hesitate to continue the series. Totally different writing style which  amazed me. Not at all like, or as well written as the first two. Doesn't seem like it was written by the same person. Sorry but this is just my take on this book. I'm sure others may see it differently but it was just not a book I enjoyed.",Disappointed,"01 11, 2014",2
AXF68RDT72QEY,Twinsie Talk's Angie J,"I received this book from the author for an honest review.Ok I must start by saying I love love LOVE BDSM books. I appreciate the honesty of the relationships and the trust it takes to be in a BDSM relationship. The love story of the 2 main CHARACTERS WAS GREAT. They are both ""damaged"" and find they can heal through the S and M relationship. I truly enjoyed watching their relationship grow. I loved reading about how the two of them become a strong unit that cannot be shaken down no matter what the tabloids print or say. I loved the honesty that these two find with one another. I give that aspect of the book a solid 4 stars.However, the erotica of the book was too much for my little soul. I couldn't connect with the S and M relationship in the least. Now am I saying it is bad, not at all. I am just saying I found no enjoyment out of humiliation and objectification of a person. I found no enjoyment of urinating on someone or allowing someone to ingest your urine. I found no enjoyment in passing your significant other around as a party favor and referring to her as a F*** Doll or F*** puppet. Now this part of the novel was tough for me to read. I just couldn't appreciate that part of the relationship which both of the characters needed. Now just because I don't like it doesn't mean I wont tell people about the novel. There are a lot of people who want to explore the relationship of this magnitude and more power to you. I guess I will stay a little closer to the 'Vanilla World"" then venture out into S and M. So my rating for this part of the book was a 3 star.My overall rating would be a 3.5 star.",intense and tough to read,"01 12, 2013",4

I liked that Estelle's abuse didnt leave her a complete mess...she was an actively good person.

A2G1XB9J4IHNVJ,"Book Addict ""Book Junkie""","Engrossing, entertaining and plausible - a fresh take on the life of Anne Boleyn.I'm so excited by this book, it's difficult to know where to start.The Kiss of the Concubine is written in the first person, present tense - two things I normally consider a 'turn off' - and yet the author handles the narration so skillfully that it becomes natural voice of the novel. The reader is privy to Anne's innermost thoughts and feelings, and in so doing we gain a different insight into her motivation.To start with Anne is insecure about her looks and only attracts Henry's attention in a case of mistaken identity - from that initial contact it is her intelligence and wit that attract him.The version of Anne created by Ms Arnopp is believable, sympathetic and most importantly - totally plausible. We discover a woman who knows her own mind but is no harpie, a woman in love who desires a family of her own, who is pressured into producing princes. I loved the interpretation of Anne as being in love with Henry but also afraid of losing his love. Their famous spats and quarrels are wonderfully written, on Anne's part motivated by crippling jealousy that the man she loves has strayed. But Anne is no blind fool, she can reconcile the dissolution of the monasteries because of the corruption within them, and when Henry siphons the wealth into his own coffers his lack of humanitarianism triggers the fateful series of events leading to Anne's eventual downfall.I am no history scholar, so I can't comment on the factual veracity within The Kiss of the Concubine, but I can heartily recommend the book as a thought-provoking and wonderfully engrossing read.","Engrossing, entertaining and plausible - a fresh take on the life of Anne Boleyn.","11 30, 2013",5

I feel like it would have been better as either an old timey, traditional historical romance or historical erotica. It came across to me as an odd combination of both that didn't quite mesh seamlessly together. I wont spoil it, but i really didn't like how the showdown between the antagonist and hero was handled. It felt like it could've been a lot more detailed but the author wanted a quick, neat solution. Not saying i was expecting a ten page brawl, but the solution could've been better.I was a little confused about why the heroine's brother spanked her. I thought spanking supposed to be erotic, so that threw me off because they were siblings.When she git married i thought the spankings would be hotter, but they felt more like a legitimate punishment (about as romantic or sensual or if she was sent for a time out ir given no dessert for dinner)Anyhow it's not an awful book, but forgettable. If you really really like spankings and  a very dtailed account of the old west, then by all means, this is the book for you.

This author didn't put any time in creating a this book for readers.The only good thing about this book is the cover art ... Props to who ever made it.

A4GBWH6JPHE6R,Karl,"This book is a decent guide to avoiding the s*** test, something every man needs to know. Its author compares and contrasts the six strategies most men use to respond to women&#8217;s s*** tests, including the two favorite strategies of members of the seduction community, the agree-and-amplify strategy and the reframe-and-ridicule strategy.I am really surprised that an author who goes by &#8216;Lothario&#8217; advocates against the use of the two PUA-preferred strategies and instead recommends that men use his respond-indifferently-and-seduce strategy to respond to women&#8217;s tests. While I don&#8217;t entirely agree with his rationale, I will admit that the strategy he recommends  will probably help most men recognize and deflect or sidestep women&#8217;s tests without getting into more trouble.Personally, I think that there are times when use of the two PUA-preferred strategies is required, such as when a woman is being bratty or if she needs to be reminded of the fact that she is not in charge. During these instances, Lothario&#8217;s evasive maneuvers simply do not dole out the requisite punishment.Still, I don&#8217;t think his generalization about most men not having the presence of mind, machiavellian mindset, and emotional resilience needed to consistently use the two strategies effectively is too much of a stretch. This is why I think his recommendation to avoid using the agree-and-amplify and reframe-and-ridicule strategies is valid for most men.However, I strongly feel that men who are successful with women and masters of &#8216;verbal jujitsu&#8217; should definitely use the more punishing PUA-preferred strategies when the situation demands it and use Lothario&#8217;s preferred strategy only when punishing the s***-tester is not necessary.Despite these complaints, I enjoyed reading this book and think that it is an invaluable resource for the average man, especially since there are no other decent books available on this topic.",Too passive for my liking,"02 23, 2014",4

The characters all have such a solid and in depth personality and their interactions with the story are very unique and original compared to most books. The writing in this story is also very unique, the author has a style that is very visually rich - showing you a picture instead of just telling you about what she is trying to express. The book is very entertaining and kept me captivated the whole way through but it also has some underlying meaningful themes that are incorporated into the story very well. There's a lot of twists and unexpected events that keep the book at an exciting pace, I think many different kinds of people could find this read enjoyable just because of that factor alone, but combined with all the other exceptional elements, I think that this book is going to impress a lot of readers from many different backgrounds.",Fantastic,"07 4, 2013",5
A3FCSEJXKU6JY,bibliogrammie,"I rated this as an okay book although it was really a 2 1/2.  I picked it up because it was about Alaska and we lived there at one time so I generally like books set in the state.Don't be fooled by the bear on the cover because the plot really doesn't have much to do with a bear!  I think one wanders into the story but it is just filler.  The plot is another attempt to sell with the current supernatural tangent--vampires, zombies, blah, blah.  I think it had a lot of potential but needed to go in a more believable mystery format.The redeeming factor was a history/geography lesson regarding Whittier and the unusual means of arriving there.  I compliment the author for his background but the story line needed a lot of help.  My experience with Whittier is not recent but he did a good job relating the unusual location of Whittier.Wouldn't recommend that Layne give up his day-job just yet but think he has some talent and needs to hone it.  I'd advise he not follow current fiction trends and come up with a believable, tight mystery.  He appears to have a background in AK so the setting offers enough variation that a good mystery book without the supernatural element would probably help his career.",If You Have a Shortage of Reading Material---,"02 11, 2014",3

There were several things that went well with the book, the story was good, the writing was intelligent, the editing was good.  However... the two main characters were so back and forth, so mean, so indecisive, so blame game that it was hard to care.  I gave it a three star for the sheer fact that the book is longer than other standard fare to be read (over 400 pages) and the author did have a good story to tell.  It was just so hard to like or root for either character I found myself NOT caring if they ended up together in the end.  I get what the author was trying to accomplish, the fear of trust, opening yourself to someone else, guilt of the living, substance abuse, mental illness and depression.  I found myself so frustrated with the main female character because she was just so weak...weak in heart, weak in her convictions, weak in her self, weak in her friends that I just couldn't take much more.I know most of you won't find the review helpful because you will  disagree with me about this book and it not being an epic love story and that's OK...that is how books are supposed to be.

I loved the details into each of their backgrounds and the flashbacks of Hawk's and Jase's respective love affair with Dorothy. They are all filled with such regret, wishing they could have done things differently. But another tragedy puts everything into perspective and Dorothy decides she's done with hiding, done being scared, and she's done wasting time.I also loved the scenes with all of the club members. They're all getting older. They're a tight family who loves and takes care of one another. Cox and Kami are always good for providing some comic relief, which was needed in this book more than the others. There were a handful of times I cried. There were also a lot of gasp out loud surprises, which Sheehan is really good at giving.The ending was amazing. Everything was as it should be for Dorothy, Hawk, and Jase.

I was also kind of surprised by some things - which was great. :)Overall, I loved Fairchild's Lady and definitely recommend it.

I had no idea this book was part of a series when I first started it, and yet it read fine as a stand-alone.I REALLY LIKED this book so much, that the pages were turning quickly and I had a very hard time putting it down.I absolutely LOVED the hero Nick, he was so darn sexy. He knew what he wanted, Willow, and went after her. They were a couple 6 years earlier and Nick had been in love with Willow. He was young at 21 years old, and had just started his profession football career. Willow was just 19 when she first met Nick, and the two of them were HOT and HEAVY. In steps Willow's dad, who thought Nick was not good enough, figured their relationship would never last, and that Nick would break his daughter's heart. So, he threatened to ruin Nicks football career if he did not break it off with Willow. Willow was crushed when Nick dumped her, and of course she had no idea it was because of her dad. When Nick turns up 6 years later trying for a second chance to win Willow back, she wants nothing to do with him even if deep down she still very much wants him. Nick finally finds a way to get Willow to give in and spend time with him, by blackmailing her into going on 8 dates with him. The banter these two shared when they were together was really something. Every time they started to argue, they ended up getting it on hot and heavy. PHEW-WEEE, theses scenes were SCORCHING, the chemistry between these two SIZZLED!!! After they dated quite a few times and things were going good, Nick slips and ends up telling Willow why he broke it off all those years ago. Willow did not react the way I thought she would, instead she gets angry and they end up separated once again. This made me want to hit her upside her head and ask...what's the matter with you?We did get some football scenes that I enjoyed and thought were a very exciting way to add some action to this read. I also enjoyed reading about Willow's career. It was a very original idea and I liked that even though her family was VERY wealthy, she stood on her own and started a business with no help from daddy.In the end, Nick decided that there was NO WAY he was going to be without Willow. I absolutely LOVED the way this book ended and YES we got an epilogue that made me a very happy reader.Overall, I thought this was a fun and an Oh SO HOT romantic read.

A36WXZPBPW4M1X,"RandiTS ""Randi""","I tried to like this book because I feel that the author has a level of talent that could produce something enjoyable - unfortunately, this isn't it.  I was torn between ""hated it"" and ""disliked it"" but anyone that puts this type of effort into producing a work for others to enjoy deserves recognition for it and, if you can completely suspend belief, are not offended by stereotypes, and are looking for an easily read book, then you might like it.The story follows a zombie outbreak in two different locations - the frozen tundra of Green Bay (ok, that should have been my first clue - yes, Green Bay is cold but frozen tundra??) and Florida.  There are quite a few characters introduced in both locations and the author describes them in great detail but it is all physical, which is a problem.  I know what the characters look like it stops there - we don't know what they are thinking, why they react the way that they do - very one dimensional.Okay - the good and the bad and the ugly..Good:  The author provides vivid descriptions of the people (physically), the locations, and the weather conditions.  He does a great job at the surface level of writing.  Spelling/grammar errors are minimal but can be annoying when repeated.  You're is the abbreviation for You are, not the possessive Your and a few There/their mistakes.Bad:  Unrealistic scenarios (and I am not talking about zombies).  One team of reporters is going to Orlando to cover a Country Music Benefit concert.  You would think that being a huge tourist destination, they would fly INTO Orlando since it does have an airport or, if all the flights were booked, perhaps a smaller location IN Florida or Alabama or even Georgia.  No, instead they fly into Nashville and DRIVE.  Seriously?  Tennessee, a state that doesn't even connect to Florida? All I can think is that he was thinking country music thus Nashville but the benefit is in Orlando.  Later in the book, this same group trying to get to Orlando decides to take the backroads instead of the interstate since it would have fewer traffic accidents, etc..  They are already somewhere in Florida when they start out.  The drive, as the author states, takes a few days because of that instead of a few hours.  Florida is a narrow state (especially the panhandle) but even the main part of Florida is not that wide.  I've driven across Florida more times than I care to count - there is no way, especially since they didn't run into issues, that you could stretch that drive out that long.  Another time, one of the characters who is from Ireland, goes into a local gas station in Green Bay and finds a very large selection of magazines, including Sports Illustrated, Hollywood Express (huh?), and International Airports and Planes (HUH?  In your local gas station?).  And it just happens to have an article about the character on the front page!  ""Nineteen year old Irish teenager, Jon Downey first pilot to graduate from Dublin's flight school and move into the United States as a U.S. pilot"". And finally, the time frame is somewhere around the 4th of July down in Florida where the weather is miserably hot during the day but cold at night and somehow, it is snowing in Green Bay.  Even in Wisconsin, it doesn't snow if July.Ugly:  I don't know if the author has had bad experiences with people in the South but he would really have to work to come up with more stereotypical descriptions of the people and even the weather.  His favorite work seems to be ""redneck"" and he uses it frequently.  Example:  Two of the characters are brothers.  One is a complete racist, both are ""rednecks"" and stupid, with neither getting a higher education than middle school.  Please - even in small towns, they require you to go to school until you are at least sixteen.  Now I am going to be stereotyping and assume that the author, based on the name and some of the characters, is from the UK.  If so, perhaps he is confusing what they call the school levels in Europe to what we refer to them in America, but you aren't going to find 11 - 13 yr old drop outs these days. Add in the character that interacts with them decides to wear a short skirt, panty hose, and a silk blouse for a 12 hr drive (Nashville to Orlando) and then complains the entire time about the heat, bugs, etc.. and she is just as racist as they are written to be but towards ""those rednecks"".  I am not even going to go into the characters that are introduced at the end, based in Cocoa FL but the author managed to come up with names that even offended me.  Shatista? Really?After reading my review, I am realizing that I sound extremely harsh.  If you read my other reviews, you will find that I rarely say anything bad about books because I appreciate the fact that I don't have the talent and patience to write a book and, as someone who reads usually 500 pages or so a day, appreciates the fact that there are others that share that talent with us.  Realize that this is my PERSONAL opinion - it is not that it is a badly written book like some out there, I think it is the stereotypes that have affected my reading experience. To the author, I would suggest making the characters more dimensional in the next books in the series and get away from stereotypes.For the reader, I would say ""go for it"".  I paid $2.99 for the book less than 12 hrs ago.  I just now looked and it is free so you won't lose anything by trying it out.

A1NHGF6R3GXT6M,Anon,"I thought this book was horrible. The writing was so, so bad. I didn't even make it through the first chapter before I started skimming and then just stopped reading. First, I do not like when authors right in first person, PRESENT tense. That completely takes me out of the story. It just sounds so false. No one narrates their life like that, which is how reading it sounds. First I open the door, then I . . . Ugh, I can't stand it. Second, the constant back and forth between Doll and Tripp was very distracting. There was barely any point of view before she was switching again. It was hard to actually get a feel for Doll. I wouldn't mind chapters or long chunks of time but she had maybe two paragraphs and then she was switching again. It also made it feel like she covered the same information over and over and over. What did Doll think about this situation, let Tripp retell the same situation over. Frustrating. Third, I thought that Tripp's character was a total jerk. I realize that this a biker novel, blah blah, but the little characterization that we did get about his character was horrible. I'm not going to read about someone treating other people badly and then assume that he'll do anything differently with the heroine . . . . but she's &#34;different&#34; because he loves her. Right, that's not how things work. Some stories can overcome this but this one really, really did not.I much prefer Joanna Wydle's two books and Marianna Zapata just wrote one that was sooo much better.

A9G85AO0S9UTB,Meghan,"Joel Nelson changes the game with his groundbreaking work, &#8216;Stupid or Liar&#8217;&#8212;he opens our eyes to the &#8216;obvious secrets&#8217;, those things that we take for granted everyday yet surprise us for the truth behind them. And Nelson attacks mercilessly and leaves no stone unturned&#8212;from sex to financial investment, this book made my head spin in the same way Carl Sagan&#8217;s &#8216;Dragons of Eden&#8217; did so many years ago.&#8216;Stupid or Liar&#8217; is probably best described as some sort of &#8220;bible&#8221; for living a BS-free, more intelligent life. Armed with his broadsword of an intellect, Nelson slays one monstrous myth after another, and fleshes out for us the bleeding truth. For instance, I have read a number of books in the past that boasts of showing a &#8220;fool-proof trading strategy that eliminates the possibility of losses&#8221;. Now Nelson&#8217;s book tells me such a thing does not exist&#8212;and that&#8217;s only for starters. He goes on&#8212;and in quite an articulate fashion&#8212;to aim his blunderbuss at other important things that matter in our lives: how we spend our money, how we invest and grow it, and how, in many more ways than we can count, we have been fed with lies by those who know how the whole thing works. Hopefully, with this book, with more people finally getting even a glimmer of an understanding how the financial system works, then maybe we can stop America&#8212;and the rest of the world&#8212;from financially haemorrhaging. Maybe&#8212;finally&#8212;we can all learn how to determine if someone is just being stupid or is knowingly selling us snake oil.What&#8217;s more, Nelson writes in a deeply engaging, enthralling manner&#8212;he grabs you attention right at the get-go, and never lets up. The book is actually entertaining even when Nelson is describing technical data&#8212;he brings it all down to a level anyone can easily understand, so that you walk away from reading the book with a solid understanding of what has been discussed&#8212;and then, hopefully, you can make better informed decisions.The bottom line: this book is not so much as about the &#8220;what&#8221; but about the &#8220;how&#8221;: he reminds us how to think better, more rationally, more logically. Yet, the book is brimming with intriguing information that will leave you making a double-take. The book, if anything, teaches is to unshackle ourselves from self-defeating financial ignorance. And as such, &#8216;Stupid or Liar&#8217; is an incredible must-read for so many reasons. Order a copy of this book today&#8212;or better, give it as a gift to all your friends&#8212;who knows, you might be able to change a life.

I read the book because, though I have read Dianetics cover to cover, I was still curious about this ""religion"". This book satisfied my curiosity.I found ""Scientology (What is Scientology)"" interesting, well written and well organized. I thought it was very conscientious in representing multiple viewpoints of both sides of various controversies.Some of the other reviews complain that this book is too short and does not go into great depth on the beliefs and motivations of Scientologists. But the book makes it clear that Scientologists themselves closely guard their innermost workings and ""deeper"" beliefs. Personally, this book was just the right length for me and covered a wide range of topics related to this cult and its history, even if the topics were not covered in exhaustive depth.If you want to study Scientology much more deeply, then perhaps this is not the book for you. But if, like me, you are merely curious and not interested in, say, converting to Scientology, then you will find most of your questions answered here, as I did.",Scientology,"01 18, 2013",5

The author's narrative is straight forward and the hi-tech is not too complex. The author explains how the electronic gags work and this makes the story easy to follow. Although NASP, the surveillance system of the Ten Provinces of America is way more oppressive that the United State's CISPA, there are parallels.This is basically the story of people's fight against autocratic state. When Freddie meets ex-cop Jennifer in prison, the book assumes a romantic dimension. The president of the Ten Provinces thrusts Freddie and Jennifer into a death game in which they must run away from armed policemen and survive for a week to earn freedom.

A1PNUOUUJ6AGUJ,Aman @ Enticed by Books,"Oh, Braden Carmichael!!! I didn't realize how much I missed his sexy, caveman personality until I read this adorable little novella. Castle Hill highlighted every important path in Braden and Joss relationship, the proposal, the wedding, the honeymoon (Oh Yeah!), the &#34;after the honeymoon&#34; period and more little things that I'm sure we all wanted to know after finishing On Dublin Street. This novella answered all out questions regarding after the HEA lifestyle and showed us that even the best of the couple don't have a perfect relationship. In Castle Hill, along with the romantic times, there were some serious fights between Braden and Joss over issues that might seem pointless to us but were huge game changer for them. I loved that we saw a different side of Braden--the one I wasn't happy with--but nonetheless, it was needed for them to move forward.I'm so amazed that within few chapters, Samantha Young was able to deliver a story that was not only a great entertainment package, but gave us a reason to look forward to more books by the author, especially the ones concerning Braden and Joss.

He is conscripted against his will into serving with the Confederate army because of his father's political leanings.  He is not a soldier and feels lost and out of place as he follows the troops to Shirley Plantation in Virginia.  There he meets the lovely Angelina Rose and begins to feel some hope and the stirrings of love.  With her fair skin, Matt does not know Angie is a freed slave of mixed race.  She was given an opportunity to leave the south and start a new life for herself, but she did not take it because she has been working as a seamstress to earn the freedom of her deceased sister's illegitimate twins.  Matt knows nothing of this.  He only knows that he is falling in love with a mysterious woman, and there is something very suspicious about his father's claims of having no family.A lot of story is packed into this beautiful, redemptive novella.

That's because, try as I might, and *repeatedly* did on two Kindle devices (both the latest K-Fire HD, as well as my trusty iMac with K-app reader), this otherwise appealing book did *NOT* play the videos which the book's description page clearly promises!I considered keeping it anyway because the text still seemed worthwhile etc, but I found I just couldn't accept that empty and misleading promise regarding those videos which totally failed to play after many unsuccessful attempts.  And I went to great lengths trying to load another video player (on the KF) which came up on a prompt at some point, but this too failed completely.  Meanwhile, I became really *annoyed* by all this unnecessary hassle and waste of time etc.So finally I just decided to dump this mess of frustration and request an immediate refund which Amazon provides most readily and only asks one multi-choice related question on their automated website system so that they can determine the basic reason for such a request.  I clicked off on something like 'defective content' (I think it was or something very close to that).I know my iMac Kindle app and my Kindle Fire HD are in fine working order, so I'm sure this whole problem is particular to this publication.  I wish it had worked, and if they fix it I'd be glad to try purchasing it again!BTW, I don't even try turning to Amazon's Kindle customer support any more as I've had way too many poorly informed and less than sufficiently attentive enough to grasp even the problem issue to be quite willing to subject myself to any more of those lame loops to nowhere but enhanced annoyance!

A hint of industrial espionage is also included.There is a lot of action in this book and the addition of a female partner for Jake increases the adventure.  She possesses a lot of killing skills in addition to a sense of humor! The Asian female, &#34;Lin&#34; also provides a real surprise for the readers. The &#34;same same but different&#34; bar made me laugh, also.Thought it was a solid novel and the characters meshed well together as well as the plot.

AU58Q4M7NCYC9,"David G ""science fiction and fantasy  fanatic""","Usually I like magic stories with more action and struggle. In this case it was simpler story of a marriage.  If you have NOT been following the series you would find it hard to keep track of the characters.  There is a wedding; but the story will resonate much more with someone who has been reading the series.  Do you enjoy going to a wedding where you don't know the bride and groom or anyone there?  I find it uncomfortable.However, in this case I felt like i was visiting old friends from the series and was enveloped with a family reunion.  Ordinarily I like to recommend short stories as means to get to sample the author and the story.  But in this case if you are not a Modern Witch series fan you will probably find the story boring and get the wrong impression of the series.  The series sucks you into the life of family of witches; but more it sucks you into the life of a family who happen to be witches.  If you feel like you already know the family then you must want to attend the family wedding and I would recommend this short story as sweet, but it is  not critical for following the overall series storyline.If you have not read any of the series start at the beginning book.  It is very reasonably priced and reading this series in order adds to the enjoyment.I am stingy with my stars. I gave this story 4 stars in part because the author very reasonably priced the kindle edition, not being greedy like some other authors. Please join me in boycotting some authors until they get more realistic in their Kindle pricing. Only for very good works should they approach $8 and anything over $9 I consider unreasonable.

AK6GUURX15A1Y,Saloma Furlong,"This is a comprehensive look at the Amish culture and religion. It is well-researched and well-written and is divided into five sections and twenty-two chapters. Each chapter begins with an extract of the material to follow. I am focusing my review on several sections that stood out from the rest of the material in the book for me.The extract of the first chapter begins with a glimpse of how a ""national crusade for educational progress""... had a bump on the back roads of rural America"" when in the fall of 1954, some 100 Amish people were arrested for refusing to send their children to school beyond the eighth grade. I thought this chapter was going to be about Amish education, but it was actually about how the Amish are a thriving people and their constant struggle with modernity. This is the only chapter in which I felt the extract did not match the contents of the chapter. All the rest of them were right on.In the second section there is a chapter on religious roots that I consider one of the best in the book -- from the extract to the end. For so long, I have been trying to put into words the Amish belief system, and I always feel I fall short. And here it is, well conveyed. The chapter begins with an Amish church service being held in the upstairs of a barn, and just as the people in the congregation turn to face their benches to pray, the host rises and pulls the barn door shut. Afterwards, when a visitor asks why he did that, the elderly bishop states, ""Because Jesus taught us to pray in private."" This conveys the humility of the Amish faith. Theirs is also a faith steeped in martyrdom and deep traditions, which is best described in the following chapters on sacred rituals in the gathered community, the Amish way, and their symbols and identity.In the third section, there is a chapter called ""Rumspringa to Marriage,"" which is another one of my favorite chapters in this book. I want to say ""Bravo!"" to the authors for challenging seven different myths and giving real information about what rumspringa is and is not. For example for ""Myth Two: Parents encourage their children to explore the outside world,"" the authors state ""Some pundits say that the church has established a cultural `time out' for that purpose, but this is simply false."" They quote an Amish woman as saying, ""Rumspringa as people talk about it is a lie. What group of parents that love their children would say, `Go out and do whatever you want and decide whether you want to be like we raised you'?"" After reading this chapter, I no longer feel so alone in trying to shatter the myths about rumpspringa. The one thing I would have added is that there are several Amish communities that require their young people to become members of the church before they are allowed to date. That gives the church authority over the young people's actions, which does not allow for any relaxing of the rules of the Ordnung.I have pondered the reason why the people in mainstream culture have latched onto the idea that the Amish allow their young people a time to make a conscious choice about whether they stay or leave. I think there is a desire to superimpose our values on their culture. We are the ones who value choice and therefore deem the Amish a better society if they give their young people a conscious choice. But that is not at all what the Amish are about. Their culture is about sacrificing personal freedom for the sake of the community. Having a conscious choice about being Amish is the polar opposite of the experience of most Amish youth who know they are expected to join the church, be baptized, marry, have and raise children in the same faith as their parents, their grandparents, and many other generations before them and live out their lives in an Amish community. If they do so, they experience a close community throughout their lives, while we get our personal freedom. As the Amish put it -- it's impossible to have both.The chapter on Amish education is literally the only chapter in the whole book with which I disagree, almost completely. I would have liked for the authors to grapple with the ethical and moral dilemmas that result from exempting one religious group from compulsory education and child labor laws. It was argued in the 1972 landmark Wisconsin v. Yoder Supreme Court case that the Amish culture would not survive if they were bound by the same laws as everyone else. This begs the question of whether it is ethical or moral for the Amish to deprive their children of an education beyond the eighth grade so that the culture can survive. This is not unlike many of the other aspects of Amish culture, in which they are held to a different standard than the rest of society.Rather than deal with these issues, the authors focus on the long and contentious struggle for the Amish to become exempt, the demise of the little red schoolhouse, and the explosion and structure of Amish schools. They also write about teachers, diversity of Amish schools, the academic outcomes of Amish schooling, and ""different world, different aims."" Unlike the rest of the chapters, this one feels unbalanced to me.At the Amish conference in June 2013, one of the authors stated publicly that there are some Amish groups that would like to educate their children beyond the eighth grade, but out of solidarity with other Amish affiliations, they are not doing so. They are concerned that it will cause controversy in more conservative groups because the authorities can point to the Amish groups allowing more education as a way to force the more traditional groups to follow their example. The author may have a point but it's not the only area in which the conservative Amish struggle with authorities and the liberal groups do not, such as with the issues of triangles on buggies, compliance of building codes, and outhouses.It took me years after leaving the Amish to realize that level of education is not determined by the Ordnung of the Amish church. The expectation that parents limit their children's education lives somewhere outside the rules of the church, but is deeply ingrained in the Amish psyche. If it were included in the rules of the church, it would technically be open to debate every six months when the bishop of each church district reviews the rules of the Ordnung because all the members of the church get a vote about whether they agree. It is rare that anyone disagrees, but this point of distinction is still a valid one. It begs the question of why education is a controversial issue if limiting education of children to the eighth grade is not one of the rules in the church.If I could change anything about the culture that I was raised in, it would be that the Amish educate their children beyond the eighth grade, even if it's for two more years in their own schools. I think so much good would come of this. If indeed more people leave the community as a result of realizing they have a choice, then the people who decide to stay would have made a more conscious choice to do so.Overall, the authors did a very good job of looking at two sides of the various issues and they wrote with a unified voice in ""The Amish."" I appreciate that the book as a whole represents an exhaustive amount of research and an unwavering commitment to writing and editing as a team. The end result is a body of work that will be excellent reference material for years to come.Disclaimer: I did not receive a free copy of this book in exchange for a review...

A2CS0MW5SQIX81,"Eartha Rembrandta ""ER""","Sounds like English, right? But you have no idea what it means because it's the Indian English dialect. Absent a translation you'll have to deal with it if you feel like hurting yourself by reading this text. It's boring prose, lots of misspelled words and bad or bizarre grammar and, of course, not quite the English most of us understand. I suppose it's an example of what we'd have to settle for if we decided to fully outsource our literature to cheap and low quality offshored providers.The plot: author is an Indian Software Engineer in heat. He 'gots' to get married ASAP or his balls are about to explode. He picks his bride-to-be and falls in love after his parents arrange for a 5-minute one-on-one talk with his princess whose main quality is that she is 'not too fat'. Eventually he gets married after doing lots of mean and nasty things to his co-workers, employer and US customer. Lacking both job skills and a moral compass he spends most of his time hiding the fact that he's not very good at what he's doing and shifting the blame on his poor quality work on others. And everything is Okay for as long as he gets closer to his goal of marrying the sweetheart. Ahh... love...There are some insights into what usually happens when workforce bargain hunting US employers hire cheap IT Indians hoping to get something valuable while paying little. False hopes, of course. What they get is mostly low quality, nearly worthless work. In his case it's buggy software from a team who will only fix a particular bug at the cost of generating more bugs in the process. So the bargain-hunting US employers, after firing their most loyal and competent but more expensive US employees find themselves at the mercy of their cheap offshore resources and have little choice but  throwing the same buggy product at the cheap, semi-competent off-shored help who created the bugs in the first place. Or, more often the not, accept a low quality, buggy product because that's the best their offshore resources can offer.The book itself is the perfect reflection of today's off-shored work ethics. Someone who can't write and has no story to tell writes and tells his boring and uninteresting story anyway and, without bothering with even the most elementary quality checks - spelling? - throws it onto the market and expects people to pay for his product.And how you do that? You send free copies of your book to maybe 1000 Amazon reviewers and ask them to review your trash. And some bite the bait because it's 'free' and it's just a few pages and, since they got 'something for nothing' they write generally positive reviews and feel important about it. At the time I am writing this none of the existing reviews show a 'proof of purchase' tag. Why? Probably because they all came from those who got a free copy from the author.",The Needful,"05 14, 2013",1

Then he is called on to do a mission but he is torn between duty and love and then in an instant a decision is made and his life is forever changed again.But this is not the end of the series and it leaves you on a cliff wondering what is going to happen next, Nim has stepped over the line and the entire family is torn apart.

A2225NJET0M7P9,"D. Bost ""Greater Ape""","A short list of ways in which the author fails at science at the most basic level possible, just within the free-sample portion of the book:Title/rights page: Author does not list his current institution of employment, or the institution funding him at the time his research was done (because he doesn't actually have a PhD and didn't actually do any research, most likely)Introduction:Formatted as a high school essay introduction, not a scientific work introMerely asserts conclusion repeatedly, does not reference actual later 'evidence'/conclusions -- so a high-school FAILED essay introduction format, then.Sec. 1 (How did we get here):References &#34;my friend, Dave Haslett&#34;-- again, no actual position or reference given (should be footnoted at minimum)Fails biology forever: asserts that we are an introduced species (we share 50% of our DNA with bananas and 99.9% with other great apes, everything else is somewhere between-- hypotheses that do not account for this automatically fail)Sec. 2 (If there are aliens, why can't we detect them?)Fails signal engineering forever: asserts that earth is &#34;going dark&#34; because &#34;all broadcasts will be low-power wireless or cable&#34; (easy counterexample 1: most of our signals are routed through satellites at one point or another.  easy counter-example 2: we're in regular communication with devices on other planets and beyond the orbit of Pluto, and will continue to be for the forseeable future).Fails basic physics forever: &#34;infra red, (visible) light, microwaves&#34; are the same kind of radiation as radio, and spread into space in the same fashion.Fails logic forever: claims that we know aliens put us here, because we know they must be out there, because we know they put us here... this entire circular bit of logic fits in a single paragraph.Sec. 3 (Seventeen factors which suggest we aren't from Earth)Sub 1: The sun hurts our eyesFails biology forever: implies non-human animals have no problems when looking directly at the sun (blatantly false)Double down on the failure: claims animals that freeze in bright lights (headlights) aren't blinded by those lights.  In actuality, that is why they freeze in the first place.Fails human-watching forever: claims humans deal with bright lights much worse than other mammals.  A lot of roadkill would like to have a word with him about that.Fails biology forever: posits that evolution is an organized force with a &#34;goal&#34; of making things &#34;better&#34;.Sub 2 (the sun kills us)Fails husbandry forever: claims non-human mammals do not suffer sun-burn, skin cancer, or cataracts from sun exposure.  Should have talked to a veterinarian about that one, bud.  Or literally anyone that's ever owned a dog-- these are all major health concerns for (mammal) pets as they age.Overall:Fails at basic rigor: in science, asking &#34;so why/why not?&#34; and then asserting &#34;because (my conclusion)&#34; is not how it works, there are those intermediate steps in there where you put in evidence and so on.Conclusion: Ellis Silver does not actually have a PhD, is a conspiracy theorist who has seen Species III one too many times, and most importantly is wasting your time.

A7XOAETR7A9HO,mg,"I ADORE SE Hall and have loved EVERY single one of her books! The Evolve series is probably my most favorite series...EVER. I really never thought she would write anything to top it...until I read Pretty Instinct. O...M...effing....G!!! This book is beyond AMAZING! Yes, it is a love story, but it is so much MORE than that as well. It is a story about friendship and family and finding yourself. Liz, Conner, Cannon, Jarrett, Rhett...I fell in love with every single one of these characters.Liz is an incredible, strong, sassy, stubborn, hard loving, funny as hell and devoted woman who has had a s*** hand of cards dealt to her in life. She is making the most of it and is totally dedicated to her brother, Conner, and her two best friends, Rhett and Jarrett. The relationships between these four is so heart warming and sweet. I truly envied the way they loved each other and how dedicated they were to one another. And while Liz is certainly not lacking in friend/family love, she is severely deprived in the romance/sex department. This is just one of the many sacrifices she has made to care for her brother. Thankfully, her luck is about to change....enter one Mr. Cannon Blackwell...Cannon Blackwell...SA...MOTHEREFFING...WOON!!! This man could charm the panties off a nun and a Baptist preacher...if a Baptist preacher wore panties ;) Seriously, Cannon is maybe the most perfect book boyfriend EVER! He is gorgeous, funny, charming, takes control in the bedroom;), protective, understanding and just all around PERFECT! Did I mention that he sings and plays guitar? I'm getting all giddy and a little damp just thinking about him...for reelz! Cannon comes into Liz's life just when she needs him most and he is her soul mate. These two are MFEO...made for each other. Their banter and their sass will have you laughing out loud...often. And their steaminess....good LAWD...it will have you fanning yourself and waking up your hubby or BF for a little ""relief"" if you know what I mean ;)Seriously, I can't say enough about this book! It is an amazing, over the top, crazy good 5 plus star read!!

A137VNT0PMDI6U,"FaeRhi ""Ginny D""","&#8230; I&#8217;m going to be honest with you all, this book made me a little frustrated and angry. This review may become a rant. You&#8217;ve been warned.With the above quote, and the setting of Scotland, I was really prepared to like this book &#8212; and for quite a bit of it, I did.  But there were just too many small issues that I found which eventually piled up enough to make me dislike the book &#8212; and I really hate disliking books. Around 87% of the way through the book, I wrote up a list of things that bothered me. I&#8217;m going to share a few of these things with you now:First off, I don&#8217;t have curly hair, but I&#8217;m fairly certain that if a woman is &#8220;soaking wet&#8221;, her hair does not still maintain perfect, beautiful curls. Especially if she&#8217;s washed up on shore after being thrown into the sea during a storm. You&#8217;d have more of a huge, tangled mess, and water usually weighs down the curls, flattening them just a little.When Alasdair comes across the mystery woman on the beach, it takes him a page or two to even give her a blanket for warmth &#8212; yes, she&#8217;s unconscious, but I actually wrote a note in my Kindle saying, &#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, man! The woman&#8217;s lips are blue! Give her your tartan and stop staring at her breasts through her night rail!&#8221;One of my biggest issues with this book stems from the fact that the woman&#8217;s family thought her to be dead, as she was thrown into the sea during a storm.  (Small spoiler warning!) &#8212; What happened was that she was trying to defend herself against a man trying to rape her, and she ran out onto the deck of their ship during the storm and was tossed overboard. Later in the book, the would-be-rapist escapes from her father&#8217;s dungeon and seemingly plunges to his death when he falls off the cliff into that same body of water, and they all assume he&#8217;s dead. Now, normally I&#8217;d be ok with this as a huge fall into icy depths of ocean and rock would be cause to think someone was dead&#8230; But they JUST GOT HER BACK AFTER THINKING THE SAME THING!!! Why not be more on guard? Why act so incredibly surprised when he shows up again to finish the job?! Come on, people! I think it was the absolute surprise on everyone&#8217;s behalf of this guy showing back up that made me toss my hands in the air.Finally, Alasdair continually mentions going back to fight the war with Robert, the Bruce. Over and over and over again&#8230; Then, towards the end, there is a battle. Just one that seems to only last for a few hours&#8230;. and is oddly only a few hours ride from where he was&#8230;. This makes no sense to me. From everything that had been said previously in the book about where this battle was to take place, it certainly seemed that it would take them more than a few hours on horseback to get there. The battle almost seems like it was just tossed into the mix of this book to make it count as &#8220;historical&#8221; and to tie up some loose ends (I won&#8217;t say what, because I dislike spoiling more). It just seemed too convenient and not well thought-out.I really wanted to like this book, and I really dislike giving out bad reviews, but I was so exasperated with this one that I just couldn&#8217;t say it was any better than a 2.5 out of 5.  It makes me sad, really. The characters were flip-floppy.. The female character I wanted to just shake and tell her to grow a pair&#8230; though upon her killing her would-be-rapist (sorry, spoiler) &#8212; THAT I cheered for. So there ARE some redeeming qualities here.  It&#8217;s just difficult having to force yourself to finish a book.","Alright, but there are issues that needed to be worked out...","01 12, 2014",2

A3DWHN2R8AVAXC,Regina Ryals,"What an amazing read! I was lucky enough to get an ARC of this book for an honest review, and I was completely unable to put it down. The author pulled me into a beautiful, Pagan world full of rich colors and tragic history. Her writing is lyrical and it flows well.Talula is an Oracle being punished for a crime she once committed. She is forced to live her life over and over again, ending in a painful death. This life is no different than any other...until Gadin. It is an attraction that won't be denied, and their relationship is full of an intense loyalty people spend their whole lives seeking, and some never find.But then there are the secrets, the surprise twists and turns, and an ending that completes one story but hopefully begins another.The author's writing is haunting and beautiful. It is like a song on the radio you find yourself singing long after it has played. It is such a new idea, and very different than anything I have read in a while. The characters are very rich.

A2RB7HLATCVYJP,Montana Vega,"This is a boy meets girl book.  The premise is the college boy is in charge of more than weekly corporal punishment as the dorm master for a bunch of college age girls who messed up in regular schools.  The boy punishes the girl over and over again based on incorrect or incomplete reasons.  He is an incompetent jerk at his job [in my humble opinion].This series (this is ""book 1"")seems headed in the direction of most boy-meets-girl stories ... eventually one of the two realizes the virtues of the other, they overcome obstacles and they live happily ever after.  Unfortunately, there is not a sliver of evidence that Scott will ever learn to trust.  Without a personality transplant for Scott I wouldn't wish the heroine's life (Brianna's fate) on any needy bottom I've ever met, no matter how obnoxious the woman.Having said all that Ms. Burns, you write well and the story idea - living with a life long medical condition -- is a nice change from the usual plot in this genre.

The characters stayed true to their personalities and subplots for up coming books was hinted at. Her attention to detail was fabulous as usual. The only thing I didn't like was it seemed rushed in certain parts. I know we fans can be demanding and we all want the next book yesterday but I would have waited another month to have gotten more out of certain parts of the book. It kept flashing days, weeks then months ahead. There's a spot where something really big happens then suddenly it's four months later. No more about it but a couple of sentences. Now whether she did this on purpose because the event will be in more detail in another book I don't know. There was also some very simple errors that makes me think she was so worried about pleasing us fans that she rushed proof reading to give us what we were hounding her for.

The author is clearly proud of his intimate knowledge of guns, their technical detail and typical performance.  In this sequel, the guns become the primary focus of the book, and the characters and story become secondary.  This wasn't close to the first novel, where I became invested in the characters...this book seems to be an afterthought effort...had the first book been of this quality, I would not have come back for more from this author.

The hero had very few to no heroic qualities.I didn't find him at all appealing or deserving of love and devotion.Not that the heroine was all that much better...In the end, I was sorry I wasted the time on finishing it.

ADGLADSOHAQMJ,The Book Runner,"This story starts off REALLY boring and I almost gave up with the third person narrative that told me all the things I REALLY didn't care about.  Chapter three had some interesting descriptions in it, but the story doesn't really get going until Chapter seven.  Even so, there is too much narration (telling instead of showing) and the characters never really get fleshed out enough for you to enjoy them.  The story line and the conflict does become interesting and I did finish the story, but I found it was similar in style to The Subzero SeriesFall into my Heart (The Subzero Series)by Rebecca Elise - just okay, not great.  The ending sets up the next couple in the series.Hannah is moving out on her own and gets a job in Nashville at a coffee shop.  She is super talented at drawing and catches the attention of song writer Jason Lane when she draws him a cartoon on the bottom of his coffee cup.  Jason noticed Hannah when he got coffee, but he is continually sought out because of his good looks and famous father, so he doesn't pursue it right away.  Jason is friends with popular county singer Cam Bishop and they both lead a raunchy sexual life of super sex with super girls, sometimes together.  When Jason starts dating Hannah, he has found the one he will give up other women for, but Hannah isn't sure she is ready for Jason, especially after a visit from one of his ex's who threatens her and gives her way more information than she needs about Jason's love life.There are some real problems with this story not being fleshed out enough and having some real boring parts, especially at first.  The ex's part is really brief and Jason's attraction to Hannah is quite mysterious.  The guys are real dogs, but I guess that is the premise of the series ""taming a heartbreaker"".  You can't help thinking Hannah could do better and ends up being bought.  The sexual encounters are sexy and awkward (realistic dialogue is sometimes odd) and happen really fast.  You do end up wanting to know what happens to the characters, but question whether to keep going with the series or not.  I really like the cover and was motivated to buy the book because of it.Similar toFoolish Games (Book 1) (Foolish Games Series)by Leah Spiegel andFall into my Heart (The Subzero Series)by Rebecca EliseDescriptive sex scenes, some profanity (f-word, Sh**t, gd) and some references to previous m&eacute;nage relationshipsWould I/Did I buy it?

Having read the first 2, the 3rd just didn't hold any interest past the first chapter. I could give it a solid four star for the story, but a 1 for the many pages I needed to skip in order to get out of the ""bedroom"" (car, hall, kitchen, shower etc) and back to the story.The storyline, in itself, was interesting and the characters were well developed. I found it entertaing; but the problem was the extensive (pages & pages) of gratuitous, explicitly described sexual situations that didn't add a thing to the story, but frustrated me as I ""slogged"" through each episode. Those of us that read romance know all about the sexual tension that this genre uses, but a little can go a long way and this series (at least what I read) went way beyond sexual tension or a little ""bedroom action"" and right into the ""porn"" zone.Again, I found the storyline very nice, but unless you are into repeated and explicit sexual descriptions, these are not the books for you.",Be Aware - explicit sex!,"03 4, 2013",2

A26KFHM8N2IF2Z,Mark Marriott,"I just finished readying the first three books in this series.  This third installment has some of the most incredible, awesome, and exciting special forces action sequences so far.  If that was it, I would have given it 5 stars.  However, the space battle action is really really poorly done.  Unlike the first book, where the author is conscientious about listing rates of acceleration and velocities and having the various maneuvers and gambits make sense in that context, in this book he can't seem to be bothered to do that work and we get just a lot of adjectives that amount to, ""they were going really fast.""  Some of the space action just doesn't make sense.  The author even fails to give us an account of how many ships each sides looses after a major battle and you are left wondering who actually won. It's as if the author just wrote the last half of the book stream of consciousness and didn't both to go back and re-read any of it to see if it made sense.  When stuff doesn't make sense it destroys my suspension of disbelief, and that is the very definition of bad science fiction.

I found the book to supply some great advice for budgeting and creating a financial backup plan.

I admire the book because of this, the author has done all the hard work of researching great info and providing it in an easy to understand manner, making even the most complex situations and terms easy to understand.

A174YG77XLY9PP,Thomas Reedy,"This is a very good, succinct, and accurate condensation of the Shakespeare authorship question, one of the longest-running fringe arguments in crank history. I was happy to see that Professor Wells takes on Richard Roe and Diana Price and that he doesn't give the arguments for the individual 'candidates' any more space than they deserve. Without becoming tedious, Professor Wells gives more than sufficient evidence for Shakespeare's authorship that anti-Stratfordians have never successfully rebutted.The distinctive characteristic of all anti-Stratfordian claims is that they are forced to invent labyrinthine, torturous scenarios to explain the most obvious objections to their assertions, i.e. both Marlowe and Oxford were dead long before half the plays were written. Their method is to peremptorily decide that William Shakespeare couldn't have written the works based on fallacious and (repeatedly) disproved reasoning, and then filling in the blanks they've created with whatever fiction takes their fancy. Not one scrap of evidence has ever been produced pointing to an author other than William Shakespeare, but anti-Stratfordians lack the intellectual honesty to look squarely at the evidence, instead positing a giant conspiracy (or not, depending on the exigencies of the moment) that covered up all the evidence for the true author.",Great summary and rebuttal of the most ridiculous literary theory in history,"02 13, 2014",5

AIR3NLDZCTFH3,"Mimi Barbour ""Mimi""","Marisela works for Titan as a Security Specialist with a licensed gun and the attitude to use it.  Belinda, her sister who suffers from Asperger's Syndrome, has decided to come home for Christmas and the surprise the family. The surprise floored Marisela at the airport when her thirty-year-old sister shows up very pregnant and still sporting the same personality she'd always shown - cold, prickly and untouchable.  Just when Marisela tries to figure out who'll be stuck raising the poor child, a black car pulls up, kidnaps her sister, shoots at her and a friend and then blows up her new Camaro. At this point, she guesses correctly that she sister's visit really will spark up the holidays. With nowhere else to turn, she's forced to call on her old boyfriend and partner from Titan. And their attraction keeps the pages turning.I loved the author's humor in this book...with lines like ""They'd taken her sister - and for that, they were going to pay in large unmarked chunks of flesh!"" how can you not like it.This book should have come with a warning / Must be read in one sitting cause it's too darn good to put down!!",Too darn good to put down!!,"11 27, 2012",5

He uses interesting psychological evidence and cites specific case studies to support each assertion.And the book has such an inspirational message: that if we can understand why we behave the way we do, we can improve upon our actions in order to better our society.I would recommend this book to anyone who's interested in sociology, psychology, or just wants to decode people's behavior.

AIYLXC2Y5I8ER,Totallybookedblog,"REviewed for [...]Broken Fairytale is the debut novel by Nikola Jensen and what a stunning, moving and emotional debut it is. The prologue was so powerful, it drew me in and Izzy's story hit me straight through the heart.""I was taught from an early age that crying and excessive displays of feelings could have dire consequences.""We first meet Izzy when she makes the decision to move on with her life after spending the last 18 months trapped inside herself emotionally following a family tragedy. What she went through was gut wrenching and learning about Izzy during snippets throughout Broken Fairytale allowed me to connect with her, bond with her and really feel for her before and after Izzy's story unfolded.""My heart just won't scab over and scar.""It was as if this girl spoke to me. I understood her needs, her wants and I ached for her in her sadness. What she had been through, what frightened her still, quite literally broke my heart.Just as Izzy makes the decision to move forward, to not dwell on the past or let the present dictate her life, fate intervenes and puts her in the path of Aiden and Declan two men who would be instrumental in aiding Izzy to move on, gain hope and help her find the happiness she so deserves.""I knew you the minute I looked into those big eyes; beautiful but very sad eyes.""Deciding to take up the offer to share a flat with Aiden, Declan and Max, she will discover that not all relationships are to be feared and that family comes in many forms.It is Declan who captivates Izzy and steals her heart.  Izzy has been closed off emotionally, seeking casual relationships and Declan doesn't do relationships at all.Declan is also emotionally shutdown and carries baggage from his past, choosing to seek pleasure i one night stands rather than give in to his heart, but he sees something deep in Izzy.  He sees through to her soul, garnering feelings he never expected to surface. He's lost in this woman and would do anything to protect her.""When I met you Izzy, you crawled under my skin, you hit me so hard and I can't stop thinking about you. I can't leave you alone.""The emotion in Broken Fairytale really gripped me. I read it in one sitting and was completely captivated by Izzy and Declan. Being afforded glimpses into Declan's thoughts via his intermittent POV's really allowed me to connect with them both, to hear both sides and to experience first-hand the connection,the love and the pain.""This is you, all of you and I love all that is you, Izzy.""There were scenes throughout with that had me experiencing nervous anticipation, you know, that sick feeling in your stomach when you're anxious of what is to come,  eagerly awaiting the outcome yet dreading what was to unravel.""Violence doesn't discriminate against who people are or where they're from.""I head over  heels in love with Declan.  This soulful, beautiful man who  never judged, was patient, giving and so DIVINE!  The scenes with him and Izzy melted my heart completely.""She really makes my heart stop. I'd give anything for more than just these moments with her.""Broken Fairytale never felt like it was written with scenes to shock for the sake of shock. The subject was handled sensitively and because of this it never felt over dramatized , it felt real and Izzy's sufferings felt raw.""Until you've loved someone you don't realise how painful love really is.""I cried with Izzy, and for Izzy. I swooned with her over Declan, I laughed with her over Aiden and I quite literally fell in love with them all.A beautifully told account of pain, healing, moving forward, growing and loving and of not letting your past or others define you.

A1E614LDQVKOYE,misshonee,"I didn't understand this book. This book was rewritten and it still gives off the vibe of a historical romance. Its called the ""Bad Boy of New Orleans"" but, there was no bad boy in it. Chance grew up on the wrong side of the tracks and his mother was a made but that doesn't make him a ""Bad Boy"". There was no fighting, burglaries or thefts. No gaggle of women or girls, no fast cars of motorcycles, not even a ""Bad Boy"" attitude. Later the author dabbles with it premise that he is a ruthless business man that will step on and over anyone to get what he wants but that falls flat when there is only a semi heated phone conversation with someone.Micah comes from money and her parents don't want her anywhere around Chance. Not only is he from the other side of the tracks but, he is also their maids son. Micah is in love with Chance and plans on spending the rest of her life with him.Chance leaves Micah in order to make something of himself so her family will have to accept him but, while he is away, he never writes or calls Micah and she thinks that he has moved on.Micah meets a man named Johnathan, who her family and friends all like so she decides to marry him even though she's still in love with Chance. One year after her marriage, Chance returns and discovers that she is married and that her husband Johnathan is a gambling, drinking, cheater who has gambled away nearly all of Micah's money. Micah refuses to leave her husband because of her pride and guilt and Chance just waits, watching her from afar.Even though Micah is a few thousand dollars away from being completely broke, her pride wont allow her to ask anyone (other than the bank) for help and she wont accept a hand out. Her pride irritates me ad nauseam!The fact that she questioned everything that Chance did or thought made this book frustrating and this book was extremely slow!",Where's the Bad Boy?,"03 15, 2014",2

A3PH7I3IXYO0D4,Brittany,"I didn't exactly dislike this book but I didn't like it all that much either. The first half or so of the book seemed drawn out and pointless and could've been covered within a couple of chapters. The two main characters, Vee and Ripp, their relationship didn't even start until just over 50% through the book. I didn't think their relationship was developed very well at all. They meet and it shows them on a date maybe once and then all of a sudden it seemed like it's been a month or two later and they love each other and the book is over. Also, the ending is sort of a cliffhanger but it seems to come out of left field and doesn't really even relate to Vee and Ripp's relationship. I think the biggest thing which bothered me was when I read a book I take the authors description of each character and get a picture in my head of what I think they may appear or look like.  It helps me feel 'connected' with the characters and their story (if that makes sense). I didn't get that with any of the characters in this book.

A360KGZAB0M2A9,Catherine P,"Bewitched is a story delving into the paranormal dimension of the unknown. A clever superimposition of romance within the juxtaposition of witchery and Valentine's Day, modern day reality and fantasy land.The story revolves around a witch called Aislinn and her missing lover and a dangerous force lurking in the twilight hunting the couple down. Unlike witches of yore, this is a modern day witch with the mandatory feline companion called Freya. Aislinn lives the normal life of a small time shop-owner in a hamlet of a town called Mystic, along the Atlantic Ocean. Aislinn specialises in love-potions and tarot reading.  Comfortably ensconced within this pattern of life, the only missing link being Jericho, her long lost love.  It is that time of the year when Cupid strikes, when the whole world is basking in love and roses.Jericho reappears and they are united but the happiness is short-lived as the mysterious force is still out there looking for them. The force which has previously hunted down Jericho is now looking for both of them.Ross has crafted a storyline which contains drama, romance, mystery, fantasy not to mention the dig at witchery. It is a quaint story set within the quaint backdrop of a small sea-side town. A little bit of everything for everyone. With the meeting of Aislinn and Jericho, the romance switch gets turned on full blast. Readers looking for romance and sensuality will not be disappointed.

A1HR2XRW6OMQVB,ncm,"This fantastic book is full of brutal truth that many women need to hear about why their relationships don't last very long or are not what they expected or wanted. This book helps to open your eyes to how you are acting and how things, such as your past and the media, have unknowingly affected you. It also helps you improve for the future and make the essential changes needed in your life.I think one of my favourite things about this book is that a man writes it. Advice coming `straight form the horses mouth' so to speak is very effective and he is obviously experienced and knows what he is talking about. His writing style is clear, understandable and humorous at times, which makes the book an easy read. I don't usually go for advice books like this as I often find them boring;  however, I'm glad I took a risk on this one as it is very helpful and it doesn't feel like a chore to read at all - I actually looked forward to reading it before bed in the evenings.When I read a page and could identify myself with the issues he talks about, I simply wanted to curl up in a ball and pretend I didn't do any of those things, but the truth is that identifying the problems is the only way to improve. I feel like this book has already helped me a lot, and I will definitely keep referring back to it.Overall, I think this book is very helpful and I would definitely recommend it to others; I have already told my friend that she should get herself a copy.

A2TCXGVNK58INC,Debra,"On the coast of Cornwall, St. Merryn's Mount stands as a family sentinel and a metaphor. When the tide is out, the home of the ancient St. Merryn family is connected to both the mainland and the people who live there. But when the tide is in, the Mount stands apart, isolated and surrounded by currents and eddies that flow with the Atlantic Ocean's rhythms. Thus is the metaphor for Girl vs Earl, the story of Miranda Marshall, property manager of this heritage spot, and Jago St. Merryn, present Lord of the manor.  These two damaged souls are both, like the Mount, connected to this piece of land and each other, yet isolated by past circumstances neither one of them could control.When Miranda first meets Jago, he is in the armory, holding an ancient cutlass and looking for all the world like a pirate from a story book. According to Miranda, he looked like someone who had ""seen and done and probably smoked or inhaled a lot of stuff."" He also looks like ""how D'Artagnan might have looked if Levis had been invented."" Jago is the Earl of St. Merryn, returned home after ten years abroad. And while the staff is hoping he has decided to take on the responsibility of his heritage, Miranda soon finds out the truth. He is selling St.Merryn's Mount to a large vacation company, and getting out. His reasons at this point are unclear.  What is clear to Miranda is that at the very least, Jago is the enemy. At the most, she is already falling for him. And with her own damaged family background and what she knows about Jago's plans for the Mount, she must confront her past and her future and try to determine if the sale presents an opportunity for her to finally let go of her own safety net and move on with her life; a dilemma that becomes more complicated as despite his plans, she and Jago become closer.Girl vs Earl  is so much more than a simple funny, romantic, contemporary love story.Ms. Ashley delves into both Jago and Miranda's pasts with obvious relish. There are reasons why these two cannot be together, why Jago feels it necessary to sell the Mount, and why Miranda is so afraid to move on.  With this heavy psychological load, you would think this novel would veer toward the dark and depressing. Nothing is further than the truth. There is humor and wit threaded throughout, a technique that allows for laughter despite the somewhat dark obstacles these two face.  There is one scene in particular that involves a rowboat, an incoming tide, some rocks, alcohol, and a very sexy Earl that will leave the reader laughing out loud. It's a talent that Ms. Ashley has that lightens up the mood of her novels and makes her characters so real to her readers. Speaking of all her characters, there are some wonderful secondary characters in this novel as well. There's Theo, a ""pillar of the community and a serial hero,"" a man who has a definite problem with the St. Merryn family, and is a rival for Miranda's affections. There's  Ronnie, head of security at the Mount, Karen the local bartender and various other additions to this colorful cast of Cornish characters.When Jago's feelings for Miranda get too strong, he confesses to her why he is selling and why he will only break her heart. But as doubts on his chosen course beset him, Miranda reveals her family history, and she herself realizes why Jago's decision is so important to him and she stops fighting it. It's beginning to look a bit like a Gift of the Magi moment for these two with one exception. In the end, they both get what they really want without giving up what they already have.I've read every one of Phillipa Ashley's novels and I have to say, this one is my favorite. Everything about it is pitch perfect and from beginning to end, the characters, the setting and the story itself ring true. Written with wit, feeling, intelligence and a good deal of the ""hot"" factor, Girl vs Earl is a must-read.",Funny and Romantic. Phillipa Ashley's hit a home run with this one!,"03 26, 2013",5
ABVOWGX8HKFJ3,Amazon Customer,I loved the whole concept of supporting cancer so that is why I bought the book.  I really enjoyed the story by Toni Aleo (Tangled in the Laces) and was looking forward to the whole story.  Then all of a sudden the story ended and said watch for the rest of the book Tangled in the Laces in 2015.  I get the concept of a novella but to not have the rest of the book released until 2015 is a joke.  By 2015 I am pretty sure I won't remember the story.  I can understand if the book was due out in a month but not 9 months.  Then who is to say there won't be a delay in the book being released.By the other reviews I am sure this is a great book but I was not taking a chance that I would get hooked on another story and it would just end.,Disappointed,"04 8, 2014",1

AWYTP64BP650I,Liz King,"LOVED this novella! Blackened Heart is the novella that picks up where Beautiful Strangers left off with country music star Jaxson Hayes. He is going on tour with Sadie Blake, the other half of Blackened Sunrise. Jaxson is nursing a broken heart over how things were left between himself and Gracie. He also wants to pursue his solo career, if he can only get out of his contract with Sadie.Jaxson and Sadie don't really have a conventional relationship. As they embark on the tour, it is obvious that the sexual chemistry is still there, but is the heart still in it? Sadie can still make Jaxson respond physically, and Jaxson knows exactly what buttons to push to get Sadie hot and bothered.I will be honest, Jaxson was not my favorite person in Beautiful Strangers, but his cocky ass really did grow on me with Blackened Heart. You can't help but fall just a little bit in love with him. He's hot, and he knows it. He's not ashamed to admit it.Sadie is another story. She has been holding Jaxson in a contract to Blackened Sunrise and a marriage. Jaxson has hurt her in the past, just as she has hurt him. She is sassy and feisty.Glenna Maynard has really written an amazing companion novella to her debut novel, Beautiful Strangers. Blackened Heart was sexy and funny. Jaxson may be an arrogant womanizer, but her really does have a good heart deep down that won my heart over.

AY3FKP3T0FAYV,JMDinGa,"""The Way of the Dogs"" is a different kind of sequel in that it takes place 80 years after the ending of the first book.  I found this to be an intriguing strategy, and one that worked.  You get the continuity, but it has several generations of time lapse that give it an interesting twist.  I'm now invested in a whole new set of characters, partly because of the heritage from their ancestors.  I love how they respect and honor their past while pressing forward into the future with new ideas.  Again, one of the strong suits of Baker's writing is his centering around family.Joel, I must advise you again to get an editor.  I know you credit your family at the end of the book for help with that, but you need a professional - or at least someone better than you are using.  Yes, there are relatively few grammar and spelling errors compared to many writers out there in this genre, BUT you really need improvement on proofing to reach your potential.  The main problem is that there were way too many missing commas and hyphens.  You need to learn when words need hyphenating and when not.  And even family members who are helping with editing chores should catch the frequent incorrect usage of ""then"" for ""than"", and the places where an intended word is simply missing.  I will purchase your next book, due out in Dec this year as you noted, but I expect to see these issues resolved.  If I am to keep your name in my short list of ""Authors to read"", which currently has only 12 in it, vs. the ""Don't Read"" list, which is now up to 56, I need to see improvements on the above.  i have added question marks by your name for now, and hope I can remove them after the sequel to ""Dogs"" comes out.

A3BVNYJROJ7UAV,"Ben Raines ""ljmcarpenter""","That's a strange title for a review on Christian apologetics, but this is just another theological discussion that tries to make something simple into something as complex as obeying all 600+ commandments in scripture.  It's completely unnecessary.Having known and had discussions with Calvinists over their wrong theology is like trying to talk sense to a Ron Paul supporter. It's the Calvinist way or none at all.  Calvinists want people to believe that God is mysterious but they won't come and and say that their god is inhumane, cruel and arrogant.  Those are human characteristics, not an omnipotent, omnipresent, all-powerful God's.  Calvinists are modern day Pharisees.  They believe they have the only, not just the inside, tract to salvation.  They choose to ignore the glaring contradictions in scripture that refute their claims of predestination.The author's mention of Rob Bell's universalist beliefs does not go far enough to expose the false doctrine of Calvinism.  That Calvinism is so intrically woven into Protestant dogma makes it difficult for any self-anointed theologian to extract the truth or expound the lie that Calivinists adhere to.Without exception, I have found Calvinists to be arrogant, rude, judgemental, intolerant, prone to mental depression, and possessing a need to belittle others to inflate their own self-worth.  You've got to possess some mental illness to accept Calvinist claims about God.  Athiests can come up with more logical reasons to not believe in God than Calvinists can offer to support their beliefs.Where do I fall on this issue?  I say that Calvinists and most Protestant teachers are teaching from the wrong perspective.  They are teaching a performance based faith at the same time they're talking out the side of their face saying that you can't achieve salvation through your works.  One Calvinist, who enjoys starting arguments just to hear his own opinion, claims that it doesn't matter what a person does who was predestined by God for salvation - that person cannot escape God's plan of redemption for his life no matter what that person does.  You can be a mass-murderer, but if you were chosen, you will be drawn back to God.  If you weren't chosen, God purposed you because he needs someone to take out his frustration on.  He has anger issues.Back to my personal beliefs, which you can accept or reject, it doesn't matter.  I believe that God exists outside of time.  He sees everything in the present.  Where we must wait thousands of light years to see the light from a star that no longer exists by the time the light gets to us, God saw the light when it formed, He saw it when it reached Earth, and He saw it when it extinguished millions of years from now.  He saw the fall of Adam, He saw the effects Adam's unbelief had on his descendants, and He saw what needed to be done to set it right so that His plan and purpose would be fulfilled exactly as He wanted it to work out.  Calvinists may agree with me so far.God predetermined how He would restore mankind to a relationship with Him.  The whole creation is part of God's plan.  Christ came at the perfect time to enact the changes that will result in the fulfillment of God's plan at the end of this divine experiment.  Some of you are stil with me.  What religion has done is to take scripture and make it about man finding God.  Every religion is about finding what we lost.  This is where Calvinism and most of Christian theology has gone wrong.  They start with the foundation that scripture is about our journey back to God when in reality scripture is about Christ period.  The entirety of Christian and Judeo scripture is about Christ in the person of Jesus and God's plan to fulfill His purpose for creating us to begin with.  In God's present, long before we came about, Christ sacrificed Himself once and for all for everyone.  In God's time it was all inclusive.  Everyone is chosen.  Regardless of what your soul decides, your spirit belongs to God for eternity. Your consciousness and whatever your soul consists of may choose to be separate from God, but the life force that is the soul is already His.  Scientists and mystics refer to the spirit as energy.  It's what animates the soul.  Without the spirit/life force, a soul and a body dies. It's worthless to God.  God created creatures in His own image - spirits, and put earth suits on them and gave them freedom to become something.  I lost most of you there.This is only an idea that just came to me and probably has nothing to do with reality, but when Lucifer sought to be equal with God, could it be that he thought he could create like God does simply because he had seen how God did it?  Whatever Lucifer touches, he screws up.  Adam's sin wasn't disobedience, it was unbelief.  Lucifer caused that unbelief. All the other sins are just consequences of our unbelief.  We lost our identity. We forgot who we belonged to. Christ went to the cross and suffered death to restore our relationship with God. We were chosen, long before Lucifer fell. Perhaps we were purposed for no other reason than for God to show the universe that there is nothing Lucifer can screw up so bad that He can't fix.  There is one Supreme God, everything else is a wannabe.We will hopefully learn all about God's plan some day, which in God's time is right now because eternity is the present.  Anyway, I find it much more believable that God stepped into time to solve our relationship problems and that He did it for everyone He created, not just a handful of miserable, arrogant brats who like to lord their birthright over others.  Certainly, the God of Calvinism is not the all-loving, all-compassionate worthy one that my God is.",You Get What You Pay For,"07 5, 2013",3

Into this maelstrom of catastrophe of mayhem, we see the central tenet that underpins these tales:&#34;We are all architects of our downfall&#34; - this bleak theme is as engrossing as it gives rise to the desire to fight against it.The action is gritty, and once-again merges historical fact with a sense of magical reality, as the story takes us through the fireball over Tunguska, to the banks of The Dead Sea to quaint English countryside where a darkness lurks.The subtext to this leaves much to ponder; do we ever really know our family and friends?

A3V1VFU4440P9V,June Collins,"There are two author's names here so I'm sure this book was ghost written. The writing is excellent. I am surprised by the total honesty of Major General John Cantwell. Obviously he is vehement in his protestations against war - unfortunately, a futile hope. As a whistle blower during the Vietnam War, I understand despair and passion. I covered this topic in my war memoir, Goodbye Junie Moon. It took great courage for the general to bare his soul the way he has in the book. However, the story somehow left a bad taste in my mouth. I too hate war but I have the greatest admiration, love and empathy for those who obey their government and answer the call to arms. Any mother, wife, sibling or friend would want to know that their loved one was under the command of the best commander possible. As I read about Major General's sleepless nights, bad dreams and sobbing outbursts, I wondered just how clear headed were his decisions. He is unlike the strong, clear-headed commanders I knew in Vietnam and I could not relate to him at all. Some of his actions seemed macabre and strange. Such as when he came upon the bodies of dead enemy soldiers in the desert. What reason could he possibly have to get out of his armored vehicle and wander around in the sand, picking up detached heads by their greasy hair (His words) and re-uniting them with their torsos? All the while he was doing this, his two crewmen were beseeching him to return to the vehicle. If I were one of those young men I would not have confidence in my leader. No wonder neither one responded when he wrote to them after the conflict had ended. Their lack of response, too, troubled him. I acknowledge there are far too many soldiers who return from war suffering PTSD but, despite his emotional trauma, this man chose to remain in an army career for twenty eight years (or was it thirty eight?). I shudder to think that he commanded ALL Australian military men in The Middle East and Afghanistan. Even worse, at the time of his epiphany when he belatedly decided to retire, he was in the running to be the number one commander of all Australian troops worldwide. Obviously the book affected me. Although I felt compassion for the man, I could not admire him and consequently did not enjoy reading about him, despite the quality of the writing.",VERY WELL WRITTEN!,"11 27, 2012",4

A2K0H6HYH8WB5F,Mvargus,"I want to enjoy the books Niall writes.  His ideas are interesting.  He puts more effort into coming up with characters than many authors and he writes in a style that is very easy to read.  Sadly, this tale showed once again why I've been avoiding his books after reading most of his Thaumatolgy series.First, Niall makes sex too important.  I agree that sex should be part of the tale, but it needs to be balanced with the action and buildup.  Niall doesn't use a lot of buildup and dialogue before his characters are tearing off clothing and falling into bed.  Worse, the sex isn't really part of the plot.  It plays out more as a sideline for Niall to bring in when he runs low on plot and wants to recharge.  Yes, in Ugly, some of the information being passed between characters is passed while the characters are cooling down in bed, but most of that could have been handled in other ways.Second, Niall's characters start out with great foundations to their personality, but those personalities don't change much.  His normal female character seems to be a highly sexed bisexual or lesbian with big breasts and an almost insatiable need to fall into bed with any other beautiful woman.  This results in a lot of rather stilted dialogue and a lack of really compelling scenes.  There also is a complete lack of tension a lot of the time.  The story has most of the emotion sucked out of it by the way that Niall builds his characters.He is an interesting read, for an over-sexed college age nerd who has only been on a couple of dates, but overall, his tales would be improved if he spent more time building the characters and less worrying about how to get the female characters into bed.

It's right up there with The Snows of Kilimanjaro, An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,  The Monkey's Paw and all of the other stories that typically round out the top ten lists.To say that Injured Reserves is a war story about a battle on a beach is like saying that The Odyssey is about a guy who sails off on a cruise.The great advantage prose has over the visual media is its ability to delve beneath the surface of things, to arrive at and reveal their essence, their connections with other things, their true and deep nature.That's what DC Bourone does with this one battle. Not only does he describe the fight itself with gut-punching, almost hallucinogenic prose, but he goes deep into its essential nature - the connections among Alexander the Great's famous steed Bucephalus, a downed horse on a Texas farm, Picasso's Guernica, and a wounded, drowning man clawing his way to the surface of a battle-wracked sea - the impersonal cruelty of what Bourone calls ""The Great Breaking Wheel of Nature"" - the inspirational quality of courage and devotion.Injured Reserves is a transcendent war story, part novella, part epic poem. The language is raw and glorious. The story will break your heart and lift your soul.Please don't miss reading Injured Reserves.","A Must-Read, and I mean it","09 26, 2012",5
A731QPENIZ4QQ,Sophia Gampton,I had never read anything by this author but absolutely loved this book. The story is typical of a private investigator hired to solve an undetected crime but that is as far as the predictability goes.The tale twists and turns dragging the reader further into the mystery of the deaths as well as engaging them in desperation to discover who the men are who are trying to shut Sam Carlisle up.The main character of Sam is a lovable rogue. He is realistic and fun.The plot of this mystery is amazingly clever and I would definitely want to read more books by the author.,Totally absorbing!,"09 26, 2013",5
A2VO8K861AV83R,"Avatheps ""Avatheps""","It's a short story, but one that you will devour and want more of the same. It is set in the not too distant future and revolves around a boy named Sam. Sam lives in a third world type of community, the ""have nots"" if you will, in a giant dump complex. People there scrounge through the trash that is dumped there from the other side of the fence where the wealthy ""Haves"" live. They exist by selling items they find to others and gathering food for themselves. One day Sam finds a book, which is unheard of in this time except in rare cases. He is determined to learn how to read it and begins a search for someone still living that can teach him. This search brings him ultimately to Old Man David. I will leave you to the rest of the story because I hate to be a spoiler. Suffice it to say that if you are fast becoming a Thomas Norwood fan, you will have to get this story ASAP. If you have not read anything by Mr Norwood yet, give yourself an Early Christmas gift and get this book or ""The Perfectible Animals"". You will be glad you did. Kudos Tom.

Then King finds some Scripture he can dig up to suport his position, but he is really a humanist/anti-supernaturalist, and he is arrogant about it.  Hardly a Christian attitude.

Showing how the Reaper's deal with the psychological harshness of that job each in their own way was interesting to read. David and Sarah were both very likable character's, and seeing them fall in love was nice. There was a lot of sexual tension, and only one sex scene but it was hot.However I only sort of liked this book. The things that would earn you a debt or send you to hell made no sense, to the point that more than one character commented on the ridiculousness of it. Considering that Reaper's would have existed since the dawn of man, and that they would exists all over the world crossing cultural and religious lines, it made the rule's make even less sense. My main issue was the book lacked conflict (even though there was so much potential for it) and action between the two lead's. I spent almost the entire book waiting for the force that would drive them apart or force them to work together. It was obvious from the beginning what their ultimate obstacle was going to be, and I was disappointed that it was the only thing the character's had to deal with after waiting so long.",Just what are your intentions...,"01 6, 2013",3

A2F63H35CDV02D,Build another bookcase,"Pick a colour (my favourite is blue). Pick a fabric (okay, silk). Sprinkle it with your favourite fragrance (mine is Light Blue by D&G;, no kidding!) Draw the material to you, inhale, clutch it to your face and neck. How does it make you feel? Good, isn't it? That's how I felt while reading Blue Mercy by Orna Ross.I somehow ended up with this book on my kindle, one of a number I'd loaded up for the summer break. Within a few pages I was hooked. The story starts with heavy baggage. Three generations of a family have reached the end of the road and the book is all about unfolding the events that led there. The main vehicle for this is the Blue Mercy Manuscript, a memoir left to the daughter when her mother dies. I'm not going to try and summarise the events of Blue Mercy. Calamitous occurrences, major life choice mistakes, dark secrets and tragic bad luck, it all happens to Mercy and her daughter Star. The mother has the benefit of hindsight as she revisits her journey from rebellious teenager to flower child, single mom and quite suddenly an old and ailing woman. She acknowledges her own weaknesses and strengths, conveys the despair of trying to raise a daughter with serious behavioural problems and carries her beauty, wherever she goes, like a deadly weapon over which she has limited control.The contrast between Mercy and Star is acute. They're physically very different and that's important to the story. Star's bulk casts a shadow throughout and her self-loathing is palpable. Mercy is gorgeous but she hates herself for being weak willed. The two women are at irreconcilable loggerheads, putting up a united front only when three men enter their lives at different times, each leading to a different kind of disaster.There's a twist in the tale. In fact, there are two twists. If you see them coming you're more perceptive than I was. Cruel fate indeed.Blue Mercy is wonderfully written. Orna Ross, it turns out, is a mainstream published author turned indie. I wish, can only hope, that one day I'll be able to write like her.There's a moral in the story of Blue Mercy. Life is not a rehearsal, this is it. You have one life, live it.",If you like literary fiction this is a must read!,"09 7, 2012",5

You also get to read Drake's desires and just how protective he is of his family.Molly and Drake are one of those couples who have everything going for them.  I love that they have this great blended family together.  Molly has a daughter, Stella.  Michael is such a great guy and is so funny!  He is not related to Molly or Stella, but has been a part of their lives for so long and has helped Molly raise Stella.  Drake has a son name Liam who does split spending time between Drake and his mother.  It's so great that Liam and Stella get along so well.  There is no fighting or hostility toward one another.  On top of that, Molly is expecting twins!Just like in the other novels,  there's no lack of very hot moments between Molly and Drake.  Their chemistry together is so great.  Drake is dominating, but wants to please and pleasure Molly so much.  Molly eventually was put on bed rest.  Poor lady was not liking it!  She was still aching for action from Drake.  Drake trying to be the sensible one would try not to give into her desires.  As much as I like reading about their hot moments together, I was peeved when Drake gave into temptation.  When that happened, I was thinking, ""Are you two crazy!  You're supposed to take it easy!  The babies!""Some of Molly's past would visit her in her dreams. She would also have nightmares about her past.  Molly does have an encounter with someone who looks like this monster from her past.  Everyone else knows him by a different identity.  Molly starts to get threatening messages from someone who knows her background and threatening to expose it if she doesn't comply with his demands.  Not many others know this part of her life.  This person so much wants to ruin what she has going for her now as a form of payback.  So Molly is left with either she gives up everything or fights back.Kitchen Promises is such a great ending to the series!  I have enjoyed this adventure with Molly and Drake.

Can Maddison help Jack to over come abuse from his past, and help him to see that he will make a wonderful father? Will they be able to salvage their relationship and marry one another for love?Montana Reunion is a sweet tale of love and angst. I found the beginning of the book to be a little slow and awkward. It wasn't until the middle of the story that things began to pickup for me. I enjoyed watching Maddison and Jack go from friends to lovers, and I found theendingof the story to be deeply satisfying.All in all Montana Reunion is a good read that deserves a spot on your to be read list.Readers will also be happy to know that Montana Reunion is the first story in the Montana Collection, and there are three more books to follow.Reviewed at HarlequinJunkie.com",Friends to lovers/marriage of convenience,"01 13, 2013",4

A179INWJ0ZLOB4,Denise Van plew,"This is my first time reading this author who is also relatively new to me. The title is what intrigued me to want to read it also. Right away I am transported into a passionate plea in a hospital room then next someone's battle to wake up. Interesting to say the least this has caught my attention right away and the many possibilities this author triggered in my mind so sit down I do to see where this author will take me. The main characters I am introduced to are Kady,Liam and some guy with a voice I personally could hear for hours because he has a Irish lilt who is Walker. Kady has just woken up after being in a coma but it is revealed she is also though missing some memory of a few years. I think that would be a tough situation to handle for most so right away have come to sympathize with her. This is not as I continue reading it would appear going to be your A typical story either which I find most refreshing since I am a reader of many years. Also right away I find myself already liking Walker but for some reason resenting Liam but it appears that is who Kady knows and loves. By now also since this author has that ability these characters have life and am now hunkered down for this journey going with the flow of this novel. The revelations that are revealed in here as she continues day to day are righteously good reading with me the spectator in a tennis match looking to Kady,Liam and Walker as this story unfolds. Of course there are also some great supporting characters that are much needed as she rediscovers who she was while also reconnecting with the memories that do try and trickle in like a red flag waving danger danger watch out for Liam lol. This is one intriguing storyline that you really read because of the way this is written. Since I am a long time reader it takes quite alot for a author to keep my attention plus also I sometimes have the ability to guess what will happen next but not so the guessing part that is with this novel. That along is like gold in the book world to me.

Personally I can do without the little kid and the baby sitting.,Anita Blake Books by L K H,"10 19, 2013",4

A2IJXV1UQ11TDY,MoH,"The dust jacket claims: ""Note that this is a newly edited version."" Not. As one reviewer so succinctly summed it up: ""Good story in desperate need of a proofreader. The sheer quantity of spelling, grammatical, syntax and just poor proofreading errors detracts to the point of overwhelming the story."" Has this so-called San Francisco writer (Cassie Page is a pseudonym, like the story) ever heard of proofreading? Stupid punctuation: ""And what do the Blackman's have against you?"" to ""She was as interesting as a chain-link fence..."" was used and then revised, leaving both sentences to rub shoulders side by side, as if one horrific assault on simile wasn't enough. The story is marred with tedious, shallow characters, and some undergo name changes mid-story: Gotrocks becomes Gotshalks (a department store?) Ohhh kay.Did said ""San Francisco author"" even bother venture across the Golden Gate to Marin County in order to become familiar with locale and story setting? Or did she just Google it from a trendy coffee shop on Melrose Avenue or Via Rodeo, and then call it quits? After too many geographic North Bay assaults, I gave up. I'd love to see someone try and attend junior college in San Rafael, or find Marin's answer to Rodeo Drive in Mill Valley, or Tiburon, or find a viable reservoir to sail on, unless of course, Novato is her fictitious Darling Valley with a coastal view and Tudor houses. I don't think so. Since when is Marin City the workingman's Marin? About the only thing she got right location-wise, was the Buckeye Roadhouse. I don't think I can bring myself finish this story, and I rarely put down any book until I finish it.Farcical sleuthing aside, OMG, it was a tediously boring material girl read. An insult to intelligence. Not even a good story. I don't care whodunit. And the author, food writer, Helen Cassidy Page, claims to teach creative writing? OMG! Minus one star.Note bene: if you can brazen through the first half of the story, the storyline picks up. First third of book needs major revision.","OMG, what a tedious read","02 1, 2014",1

This ebook is fascinating, and best of all, there's no fluff. The author establishes his authority, introduces you to an app he created for sound engineers, and then get's right into the meat and bones of his expertise.I think this ebook will go very far as long as the author makes sure to market it to all the younger men and women out there that would give their big toes (maybe not drummers) to learn from him. Even though I have zero experience in the industry, if I was put on the spot, I could probably wing some decent production value now lol.Well put together, nice cover, and utterly priceless information.

AI1SJDEEY553T,Juliet GR,"""Until you, I didn't know the true meaning of the word.""Nicholas Leighton has been deeply hurt by two women in his life. He no longer believed in truth love and thinks that every woman who shows an interest in him is either wanting his money or the title as Duchess of Sethe. Then came Ashleigh Elizabeth St. John, a young lady is nothing conventional. It was love at first sight when she laid eyes on the Duke of Sethe. Believing that she had the power to change him, she tolerate with his insult, his temper and even his rude attitude towards her. Does she have the power to change him?The story between Nicholas & Ashleigh is the old fashion historical romance we have read about. However, my heart still cringed at every hurtful words that Nicholas hurled at Ashleigh and my heart melts on the rare occasion when his affection towards her shows up unknowingly. Yes, despite it being so cliched, I like it. The tiny twist at the end of the story revealing the family secret didn't came as a surprise to me. I have sort of guessed it from the start.However, the first quarter of the book is really slow for me and I had a hard time getting into the story. The characters wasn't appealing to me and the cold attitude of Nicholas was seriously putting me off. How can I even like a character like him? In fact, I still doesn't like him now that I have completed the book. Brendan and Alex are definitely more likeable. I honestly felt that Ashleigh is too good for him.The epilogue sounds like the author had a sequel upcoming for the secondary characters in this book and I am definitely interested to read about them if she decided to write it. I am recommending this book to all historical romance lovers who doesn't mind reading the same old fashion romance all over again.Note: I have received a copy of the book from the author in exchange for an honest opinion.","""Until you, I didn't know the true meaning of the word.""","02 10, 2013",4

It just felt like he'd let the bullying of Erin go on for too long. His actions didn't match his words.2. It was all too predictable. Early on, I had figured out the ending. I just didn't know how she would get there. I feel like I've read this story in different ways in several other books.3. There wasn't any true closure. Where did Weston go to school?

A29A3GQ24JQHYA,KT,"There was so much that I did not like about this book, I am not even sure where to start.*The writing style- it is written in first person, as though the narrator is talking directly to the reader.  I have no problem with first person, but it is very awkward to me when the author adds things like, &#34;don't judge, you would do the same this in my shoes&#34; or I'm a teenage girl, what do you expect&#34;*The pace- This book seriously needs and editor, it drags on and is very repetitive.  Ayma tells us how boring her life is and we no she is not kidding since we are forced to read every detail of her boring days over and over and over!  Even when the book finally skips ahead a few weeks, the author makes sure to give a summer of how Ayma went though her normal daily routine.  Things are explained that we just read a few chapters back.  Nothing really happens until they very end of the book and then it is rushed and left with a cliff hanger.*The romance- I did not feel any chemistry for this couple at all.  They had terrible communication.  All of their conversations were boring and trivial.  They did not discuss anything of any significance with each other. They are together for over 3 months before Ayma finds out why Colton was in jail for 2 years.  Ayma was constantly having to guess what Colton was feeling and thinking.  He offers to 'give her rides' to things rather then asking her out, and then seems surprised that she does not know it is a date.  She is all excited when he introduces her as his girlfriend, since she did not know if they were dating.  She says that at their age, guys must not have to bother asking girls out.  Sorry, but I think at any age both people need to agree to have a committed relationship.  There are a couple big misunderstanding that get blown way out of proportion, because of course, they don't just talk to each other, but rather make assumptions and hide.*The friendships-  Ayma has a group of friends that I think she had been hanging out with for a while, but for some reason they had never been to each others' houses before.  Ayma goes home alone and is bored every night, but when she needs party outfits her friend goes out and gets them for her, rather then them going shopping together.  It is painfully obvious what is going on with the best friend, even though nothing is reviled about it in this book.  It make Ayma look pretty clueless when I can figure out what is up and she can't.My final huge pet peeve in this book was that the girl never eats!!  She skips breakfast every day, she has an apple and milk for lunch every day and then she usually goes home and throws out the dinner that was left for her and eats some peanut butter crackers.  When she is at other people's homes for dinner she is too nervous to eat, or loosing her appetite for some stupid reason.  I just seemed really odd to me that the author made such a point to talk about her not eating.  It is certainly not setting a good example for younger readers.I could go on and on about things that I did not like about this book, but I think I made my point.  The only positive is that it was interesting enough to make me want to see how it would end.  That is why it gets two stars rather then one.  I save one star for books that I don't even bother trying to finish.  Rather then just giving up on the story I skimmed to the end to see what would happen.  It ends in a cliff hanger and I don't care enough to bother with the next book, so I guess I will never know.",Just not good,"06 18, 2014",2

A2DYE6RAL1OW49,Bard of Calandra,"This appeared to be a novel about King Arthur. I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s why it showed up on my recommendations. That&#8217;s what I thought it was, and that&#8217;s why I bought it. But I was wrong on both counts. Carausius was evidently a real person who might have been the basis of the Arthur legend. And this may be a work of fiction, but it only aspires to be a novel. Characters&#8212;no difference between minor, major or plain ol&#8217; spear carriers&#8212;inhabit a world of described sights. There are few sounds, no smells, no tastes, and when a warrior gets half his foot sliced off, it does not appear that he feels anything either! Maybe, instead of a novel, this is some sort of gray afterworld, full of dust and shades rather than flesh and blood characters.I&#8217;ll forgive a book pretty much anything if the author makes me care about what happens to the characters.Even one single character. Fine, the author tells me a whole lot about the Roman army&#8212;but in a novel, I don&#8217;t want to be told, I want to experience an interesting, outside my experience reality through the eyes of a character.

That's what was going on for me as I read more and more into this latest installment of The Gabrini Men Series. But, ""it"" never came.PROS:It was about our beloved Sal and Gemma.We learned more about Sal & Tommy's mother and family.Gemma's law practice improved.Reno, Tree, Tommy, Grace, and Jimmy Mack made brief appearances to share the love.Sal popped the question.CONS:The storyline made little sense. Gemma had a court case that she won, but we don't get any more details about how she won. She now owns her own professional office building, one of the renters tried to scam on the rent, but we're never given any info on how that was resolved. An old boyfriend tries to blackmail her for 2 mil, she tells Sal about it, but she never mentions the 2 mil to him, yet later on Sal is musing about the 2 mil as if Gemma HAD told him.

One scene in particular supposedly lasted for hours and hours, but come on! Not even in a romance novel is that believable! Get real!If this book is supposed to be the intro to 'The Sinatras of Jericho County' series, then I can already tell that the series is gonna be a real yawner!It was bad enough to see Sal have to carry the burden of having to ice his father to save Tommy, but now he has to carry the burden of icing his mom to save Gemma? Sal would have to be nuts to pull that off! Too much for any character! And, up to this time, Gemma has been portrayed to be a smart, strong, independent black woman. But after all the carnage, Gemma's father informs her that Sal is NOT Mafia, but he IS a Mob Boss ... Is there a difference? Then, we are supposed to believe that she has become so 'dk-whipped' over this man to where she would be that desperate to marry him the first time he asks her? No way! After that, Sal runs out of his home naked when she says 'yes'? Are you kidding me? As even Sal would say, ""What the #%*@!""I think this series is done for even though I'd hate to say goodbye to it! I don't know ... maybe the author needs to take a serious break from writing for a while! Oh well ... here's to finding a newer, more refreshing author!",... I ...WAS ... STUNNED!,"06 13, 2014",1

AC0CW3OQUS1ZJ,Motherof2wi,"I got this book about two weeks ago. I didn't change what I ate, I didn't have to make funny drinks or follow a horrible schedule of eating and not eating and all the other funny things books promise to make you better. I lived my life and when I got home, I did the 20 minute cycle before dinner. (I admit that I started at the kitchen sink as there was no way I was strong enough to start at chair height for the push ups.) In just over two weeks, I have lost only 3 lbs according to the scale, but according to the tape measure I have lost 4 inches at my waist and 2.5 off my hips. All of these I have been able to do in my tiny apartment without a problem. I didn't have to buy anything. I simply had to give up the time I normally sat watching the news...

A2KML17UKM29S2,"Cary Morton ""Author Unpublished""","I received this book directly from the Author/Publisher in exchange for an honest review.Did. Not. Finish. I tried&#8212;I really did&#8212;I stopped and started this book half a dozen times in an attempt to get through it, but I stopped at 13% in (beginning of the fifth chapter). This story started off with promise. The narrative was clear and concise, and with few errors (I found three in the first five chapters). Unfortunately, that&#8217;s just about the only positive thing I can say about this book.The narrative had a penchant for skipping large amounts of time without any indication of a time switch. Months, even years would pass within the same paragraph, sometimes even the same sentence. It became very tedious to follow the constant time jumps that seemed to occur for no particular reason. For the most part, the narrative came across as dry, and lifeless. Talia didn&#8217;t seem to have a personality. Most of the time she showed almost no emotional reaction or inner turmoil unless it was to burst into tears (which she quickly stifled). I didn&#8217;t feel like she even cared about any other human beings aside from her childhood friend Camon. When she started cutting herself &#8220;to feel something&#8221; I rolled my eyes. It made me angry on behalf of the people who actually do have a cutting problem that this bratty, unfeeling princess had been given this severe emotional problem for what? So that the reader would feel sorry for her.From there, events seemed to tumble by as the story skipped ahead in quick succession&#8212;leaving the narrative feeling rushed. There was little detail put into the descriptions, and the dialogue didn&#8217;t seem to make an impact on the story&#8230; a lot of time was wasted just having characters greet each other and ramble on about unimportant day-to-day things.I think the most aggravating thing about this story though, was that it was so unbelievable. I know this is a fantasy story, and there are vampires and werewolves&#8212;that&#8217;s fine. I can suspend my disbelief to a point, but there were moments where Talia and the other characters said/did things that seemed to come out of nowhere, and had little explanation.One example I can give of this is when Talia became Queen. Her father&#8217;s funeral and her coronation were on the same day, but there was no mentioned grand ceremony or time set aside for her to mourn. Talia didn&#8217;t even seem to care that her father had been killed. She signed a document, sat in a chair for a few minutes, and then walked out of her own father&#8217;s funeral. That was the end of that. Even in a rushed situation, I don&#8217;t believe this series of events would have happened.Why did her coronation and her father&#8217;s funeral have to be the same day?Why did they have to be in the same location?Why is she so soulless that she can just walk out of the ceremony?Given that she&#8217;s a minor, why aren&#8217;t there any other relatives around to take over the throne?Why isn&#8217;t there an interim King?Why was there a treaty of peace between her kingdom and the one next door because her father had been killed in a war with the other country?It didn&#8217;t make sense. There are just too many questions that were left unanswered, and it felt fake the way it was all set up.Another example would be in Chapter 4, after the Vampire/Human Treaty meeting. A Vampire she hardly knows (she&#8217;s literally only seen him twice, both times for less than an hour) breaks into her palace bedroom, and she doesn&#8217;t freak out. In fact, she hugs him and he declares that he&#8217;ll always be there for her. I literally stared at my kindle and went W.T.F. I&#8217;m sorry, but I can&#8217;t suspend my disbelief that much.In the end the book came across as boring and unbelievable. I didn&#8217;t feel engaged, and none of the characters stood out as having any depth&#8212;I couldn&#8217;t get past it. I did not like this book. Would I read it again? No. Would I recommend it? No. In my opinion it is sorely in need of a good set of beta readers to fix the plot holes and fill in the tensionless spaces. This book felt lifeless.

A32EUN2MXY9FHT,Summer's Book Blog,"SUMMER'S BOOK BLOGThat Which Destroys Me is a dark romance novel by Kimber Dawn. This is the type of dark novel that comes with a warning label that should be followed, not everyone will be able to handle the story of Stella and Wesley. Stella is a young woman who has been dragged through hell over and over again but continues to fight and survive. Wesley is a rich guy who came from poor beginnings and makes no apology for the fact that he is a bastard. He says and does what he wants with no regard for other people.He is also a dom who has gone too long without a sub and while looking he stumbles upon the perfect broken angel with a fighter's spirit. They come together and suddenly nothing else matters. Wesley will push her boundaries but Stella will not break. However strong Stella may be she may end up destroyed by the only man she's ever loved.That Which Destroys Me is a twisted story of soulmates, obsession and a love so intense that it can destroy everyone involved. This emotionally gripping story contains unimaginable horrors that will break your heart and leave it shattered, the reader needs to be prepared for dark, heavy and emotional subject matter. Stella is a character that you can't help but love and respect, she has been through things that no human being should ever have to endure but she came out fighting every single time. When the reader first meets Wesley he seems to be an unforgivable jerk, he does redeem himself a few times however you will alternate hating him and loving him throughout the entire novel.Both characters are well developed with detailed back stories that help the reader emotionally connect to them and understand who they are. The author also uses alternating point of view which allows the reader a deeper insight into each character. Wesley's dominant sexual nature is so hot that I was practically salivating and Kimber Dawn gives the readers some amazingly panty melting sex scenes. The relationship between Wesley and Stella is a roller coaster ride of love, hate, sex, fighting and many, many secrets that threaten their love.Somehow their intense, passionate BDSM relationship helps to heal the wounds of Stella's soul. &#34;These ties that bind me, he breaks and replaces with restraints of his own; but Wesley's ties are not ones that bind, they're what sets me free.&#34; Wesley's love and dominance started to help her heal but fate wants to further test Stella and see if she can be totally destroyed. There are some incredible plot twists in this novel that will leave the reader reeling, I actually had to stop and re-read because I couldn't believe what was happening!Kimber Dawn is brilliant and creative, this plot line takes unexpected turns in all the right places and captivates the reader from the very beginning. I knew after the first few pages that I was going to love this novel and I couldn't put it down after I started.That Which Destroys me is the polar opposite of a fairy tale, there is no happily ever after, in fact the ending is soul crushing but perfect for this novel, I wouldn't have wanted it any other way.",POWERFUL READ !,"05 9, 2014",5

A2SPF129OKGORN,Gisela Hausmann,"It was the first chapter of ""Secrets of the Dead (Man with a Mission)"", which drew me in. The reader gets introduced to the novel's main character Ambrose Lincoln, who at that moment attends his beautiful young wife's funeral. That alone would be tragic; what creates suspense is that Ambrose does not know how she died. He also does not ask. By the time we find out that he cannot remember ever having met his parents we want to know: What is Ambrose's secret?Ambrose is an assassin, and that is all his life revolves around. He is a perfect tool for his employers; he cannot remember too much from his prior life. When memories come up, he cannot remember to which phase of his life they belong. Methodically he follows instructions. He does not ask any questions. Then again, assassins never do. The ones, who ask a question find out that they asked one question too many.The book's story retells the historic events of the Reichkristallnacht. A photographer has managed to take pictures depicting the horrors the Jewish population experiences. If the pictures surface the money wheeling and dealings of major power players will be threatened. Ambrose Lincoln is supposed to solve the latter's problems.As a history buff I appreciated the fine presentation of the historic events, as a fan of spy novels I had met some of Pirtle's characters before, the long-legged blonde, the sarcastic evaluator, the deadly sniper, but Pirtle's writing style and rhythm were new and fascinating. This author reminds us of things we already knew, only we never thought about them this way. His language is enticing:*""His head throbbed. A sharp pain cut into his chest. Indigestion, he thought. It couldn't be his heart. Atticus laughed.  He didn't have a heart. That's what his enemies said anyway.""*""She smiled. On the list of things she did best, the smile was third.""*""He knew which hands to shake. He knew which cheeks to kiss. He knew the names of the big money boys. It was his job to know where they kept their skeletons and the deadliest of their dark secrets. Some he had personally removed and hidden for them. Atticus Chandler never dug any graves, but he chose the cemeteries.""*Highly recommended to history buffs, spy novel fans, and crossword puzzle solvers.

A1YUY9VZKFUZDI,James Dainis,"I read the first Galdir novel and looked forward to seeing Galdir's adventures as a Roman auxiliary in Roman era Britain.  This novel was well written to give the reader a sense of what it may have been like amongst the various tribes in old Britain, or more accurately, what is now Scotland.  There is much to keep the reader interested and near the end it becomes a real page turner.As usual, Galdir falls in love. Again.  With a dramatically beautiful woman. Again. This one is a warrior princess or sword maiden, beautiful and independent. Perhaps the author had in mind  film rights  and needed a statuesque, leather clad beauty who could swing a sword like a Samurai  to entice movie producers.  Still, they do have an interesting relationship which adds to the story.I prefer my barbarians not to engage in endless introspection or to wallow in self pity.  There is quite a bit more of that than in the first novel in the series.  What with Galdir mooning over his lost loves, having weird dreams and visions,  one would think that he hadn't the time to unite the various tribal factions  to overthrow the Roman yoke.

Men and relationships are the last thing on her mind until she met Dex Porter the sexy ex marine, underground fighter, who is still-hunted by his time spent in Iraq.I liked Olivia and Dex they had issues, and fears. Oliver was strong, independent, sweet and feisty. Her past meant that she had been coasting through life, she had fears of abandonment, and her heart is guarded. She doesn&#8217;t want to get hurt, and therefore, keeps people at arms length never truly letting anyone in.&#8220;Maybe I had always been a little closed off but I had reason to be&#8221;Dex was rough and sexy may have come across as arrogant at first, but he really is a good guy who was caring, funny and fiercely protective at times.

Olivia and Dex may have found in each other someone who could make them stronger. Someone who could help them heal, and move forward with their lives. It was both moving and touching at times to read.&#8220;There was something about her that both captivated me and made me feel comfortable. There was no expectation or judgment with her, and it put me at ease.&#8221;&#8220;Sometimes all it takes is finding something to fight for&#8221;Overall Break Away, was another enjoyable quick read from Ellie Grace, I liked her writing style engaging from the start. The story flow well I liked the way Ellie made her characters develop throughout the book. Great secondary characters such as Dex&#8217;s sister Amy and his best friend Tate both great supports for Olivia and Dex. I would read a story about them.  It was nice to see Nora and Jack back character from the first book This Time around, and see a snippet of what was going on in their lives.The ending was good, no cliffhanger, but I will say my only slight disappoint was the epilogue. I love my epilogues, and I want them big, ones that as I swap the last page I&#8217;m left with a big fat grin on my face, and with this one I liked it, but I wanted more, to see more into Olivia and Dex&#8217;s future. However, with that being said I would recommend that you Add Break Away to your TBR list, and if you haven&#8217;t read This Time around I would also add that one too. I look forward to reading Ellie next book.",An,"02 10, 2014",4

A1MT0PFRXKDQJO,ANNETTE M GUERRIERO,"Today's review is on The Death of Me by Denise Grover SwankThe Death of Me is a short account of the death of Denise's husband Darrell and how she has dealt with it over the now six years.I have read all of Denise's books, and have the wonderful privilege of calling her my friend, a title I do not give out easily. And though I am aware of what she has gone through, I have never felt so close to her or have felt so saddened and helpless.I must confess that I already knew that this would be a cathartic exercise for Denise; as I have often suggested my clients to this exact exercise after the loss of a loved on, but I didn't know that I would be touched so much. Tears pouring down my face at the pain Denise had suffered, and the pain that Darrell as a doctor himself must have felt as well.As I read about Darrell's stay in the hospital following his crash and the things that my friend had gone through, I realized how very much I am blessed with my own spouse. We all have our hard times, and perhaps indiscretions, and of course there are the arguments, but in the end nothing can prepare you for the loss of your soulmate.The Death of Me is inspirational. It's thought provoking, and heartwarming. A must read for anyone in a relationship. Believe me, you will never take your partner for granted ever again.Thank you Denise for reminding us all that life is not only precious, but it could end at any moment.5+ of 5 StarsAvailable at Amazon",Gothic Mom's Book Reviews,"02 11, 2013",5

A3CBWFKNMTYG2O,Sacred Mom,"When purchasing a book I look at other's reviews, the length of the book vs the cost, and my interest in the sample.  This info did get me started on the Star Chase series of which I read all 3. This SCI-FI series had humans, super-humans, aliens, romance, fancy ships with advancing technology and space wars. This first book was good enough that when finished I did get the next book however I will warn you, the genetically engineered super humans (all part of the royal family of ""Montgomery"") made to be better at ruling the human planets were the main characters. They apparantly out-think everyone and some even have special mind powers after 500 years of being tampered with. I say ""out-think"" because the drew conclusions without data, their speculations easily became fact, with little or no data to go on about their alien enemy.  I am usually good at knowing what will happen next, but when you read they have a fact and you go back to see what you missed on how they got that ""fact"" you will be disappointed because you will not find how they got those facts.  That is the reason this book got a 3 star rather than 4-5 because the author just glossed over the fact finding parts of the story and made alot of good guesses on little information.  When you see a planet with dead aliens there are ways of finiding info: dating their ships, understanding their culture and anatomy maybe even being able to link into their data bases to learn more.  That exciting stuff was missing from this series, and when it was convenient some blanks were filled in by a psychic.  It was between book 2 and 3 when ""regular humans"" were seen as a possible asset. I think this series would be best used as comic books. On book 1 I felt the editing was better than book 2 and 3.",Book 1-3 of The Star Chase Series,"08 28, 2013",3
A1WCOC84XYDQES,Becca,"As a new author, I've realized how helpful reviews are and wanted to help this author out. I snatched this book up when it was free on Amazon, which I do quite often--but half the time I don't finish them. This one was different. I read it in three hours. The first chapter picked me up and propelled me through a roller-coaster ride that gave me tingles. Great job, Juli Caldwell. I'll separate my review into three parts:World/Environment- The author definitely gave off a haunting, dark, gothic feeling with the story occurring in a small town. It was very believable and well-described.Characters- Again, the author did a pretty good job here. The main character was fantastic, well-rounded, and felt very real. So did her best friend. Her love interest felt a little flat and predictable, but that was forgivable. I did wonder about the father, though. It took awhile to figure out that the African man was the same lovable dad that people called Big Billy. That could have just been me, though. And I wondered why Big Billy didn't take on his daughter's quest himself. Why, after so many years of guarding the portal, couldn't he do it this time and sent his daughter to do it instead? If that was explained, I didn't get it. The whole quest thing didn't quite feel right. Anyway, this portion needed a little work but was still good.Plot- The plot was great in the beginning but fizzled close to the end. The ending that the story built up to didn't happen, and the promises of more action and development in the next book wasn't as gripping as a dynamite ending in this one could have been. I also failed to understand what exactly the main character intended to do at the climax. If she could banish demons, why didn't she even try? The face-off between her and the villian at the end felt very flat and contrived, neither one doing anything of consequence. It's a shame, because it was built up so well.It's not often I speed through a book like this, though, and get to the very end. That definitely says something. I give it four stars for that, for the awesome cover, and for strong writing. Good job, Juli.",Pleasantly surprised,"10 7, 2013",4

AVO3NDENWYHEH,gpangel,"My rating: 4 of 5 starsA Murder in Auschwitz is a January 2013 publication. The is a self published novel. This is a legal thriller set in Germany, before, during, and little after the war. The story alternates in time between 1929 and 1943 Auschwitz, Germany. We meet Manfred Meyer as he is just starting his career as an attorney. He is a family man, married to his beloved Klara who is expecting their first child. Manfred is mentored and taught to be a good defense attorney. His law firm is like a second family to him.  He is given his first murder case, a case that will solidify him as a defense attorney, but will also have a drastic effect on him in the future, a future he could never have predicted. The alternate chapter set in 1943, we find Manfred in a death camp. He has been separated from his wife and  twin daughters. He doesn't know about their well being. He finds out right quick what the score is and what his future would turn out like. His only wish is to see his family again. The last thing that Meyer ever expected was to come face to face with a man who he had successfully defended against a murder charge. Now an SS soldier, the man finds himself once more charged with murder. He makes the unusual request to have a Jew participate in his defense. When Meyer is approached about the situation, he makes one demand- to see his family one more time. The author does a great job of separating the time frame of past and present. The normal life Manfred had and the wonderful mind he has. Then the stark contrast of being in the death camp. Now, there is no way to get around the depressing atmosphere of the camp. It is not easy to read these chapters in the book. It is a heart wrenching account of a man's life being reduced to the death sentence of the camp. The depiction is very realistic, but it's not overly graphic. However, it is still disturbing.  These chapters were emotional, so be forewarned. Manfred is a great guy. He's devoted to his family and takes his job seriously. He takes pride in preventing innocent people from going to prison. He is honest and hardworking and is well liked by his co-workers and boss. He is also very, very smart and clever. Although is realizes his life is doomed no matter what, he makes the best of his dire situation... and perhaps has the last laugh? There are a few really shocking twist in the plot involving both murder cases, past and present. Manfred suffers some gut punching revelations and those are some of the hardest things to get over. After all is said and done, the book ends on an uplifting note and with a wonderful twist of irony. I received this novel from the author for an honest review. If you like historical mysteries or historical fiction in general or legal thrillers, you will like this book. As with many self published novels, there may be a few typos here and there, and maybe some sections could have been cut down a bit to hasten the pace of the novel. Other than that, this was a very well written novel with a compelling and emotional story. Overall a B+.","A Compelling, Emotional, Historical Legal Thriller","07 23, 2013",4

A2Z78GUCQ1N6JI,Meg A.,"Unfortunately, I bought this book without remembering that I had already bought, disliked, and immediately returned Clegg's book about Marie Antoinette. Minette was purchased on a whim, forgotten about, and rediscovered weeks later. Her formatting has improved somewhat, thankfully, but there's still a large amount of run on sentences and awkwardly written dialogue. And as other reviews have pointed out, Clegg has a tendency to pop in phrases and mannerisms that are very modern. I would seriously suggest that Clegg look into a new editor (and if she doesn't have one- GET ONE.) or a secondary editor, and also beta readers that will be critical of her work. It really could be wonderful.As for the substance, Minette is just as lacking as Clegg's other book I attempted to read. It is mostly filled with descriptions of clothing, rooms, food, and some background for each character. This is then lightly glossed over with a thin layer of story line in which Minette basically stumbles through her life, alternately disliking and loving the various men in it. It's clear that Clegg has done a lot of historical research, however that does not make up for her poor writing. When the book begins Minette is 10 years old, but Clegg gives her the thoughts and dialogue of someone in their early twenties. This leaves no room for growth in the main character at all, both in her mind and how others speak to her, and the same could be said for several other characters.There is also no real development in the relationships between the various characters- Clegg simply flips a switch from 'dislike' to 'like' and that's that. The main problem there is that every chapter moves the timeline forward several months (up to a year) at a time, and Clegg is unable to bridge those gaps in the story and character relationships. And finally, there are also moments when she introduces a character, such as Edwards sister Louise, and gives absolutely no real background or description. Louise is 35 years old when she comes to Paris- but Clegg describes her as simply an &#34;auburn haired young woman&#34; and writes her as if she's some 16 year old off on adventure.In short, the book is well researched but rather poorly written.","Buy this if you like to ""hate read""","08 8, 2013",2

AIVIQ86PO0308,ereviewer,"This book is well written and shows a depth of literary talent often missing in contemp romance. The characters are well developed and there is enough emotional conflict to keep it interesting. Having said that, I personally found it difficult to warm to the main characters. I found nothing worthy about the hero especially in his treatment of women and using meaningless sex as a means of masking emotional pain and lashing out in jealousy whenever things seem at an end between them. The heroine irritated me - period. And I found it bizarre how easily she forgives that promiscuity. Notice how the women in these books remain faithful during turmoil but the men get to have flings? It is just a double standard cliche I find annoying in this genre. Right to the end I was hoping she would kick him to the gutter and find a really good guy who didnt just espouse biblical principles but actually lived them.

Nothing too contrived or unrealistic. No stupid, whiny women or obnoxiously chauvinistic men (yeah, they're all He Men, but not too the point of being caricatures).Each book is a story unto itself, so no cliff hangers hanging out until the next book.

Even just saying her name puts me a little on edge :) I definitely have a team (as does Mia) but all I will say is Cathy is married and you will feel for every single character in this book. But that's all I'm saying. Honestly, after finishing and emailing Mia, that's more than the original one line I told her was going to be my review!""Falling in love with the wrong person is easy. Falling in love with the right person is easier. But falling in love with your soul mate is the easiest.""Now that I'm done with this book, I feel like all I want is for someone else to read it so I can discuss the heck out of it. AND what's even better, is it's a stand alone. Could there be another book, sure, but I think it would ruin the end. Every thing Asher does in this book is perfect for her story. The flash backs, the relationships, the crushing reality of it all, and the end. As you can tell, I'm still a little torn up. So make sure you read it, then message us, because I can't wait to hear everyone's thoughts.""Cathy, meeting you was chance, falling in love with you was destiny, and loving you is my reason to exist. I could tell you all the different ways I love you, but words are cheap.""AND what I can't wait for even more is what Mia Asher writes next because if she can get me to read this, then I'm pretty sure she could write her name over and over and I would still give it a good rating!",I'm still reeling from this book!,"08 25, 2013",5

A33Z7O75Z6DE0E,amtmcm,"This book has too much going on for my tastes. But it's not unusual for me to really enjoy books that others' review as boring. To each their own..... I have a low tolerance for angst, so reading about Delia's guardian forcing himself on her and later kidnapping her and nearly raping the hero's sister was not the least bit enjoyable to me.The dialogue is pretty good, but some manners and events were just a little off and didn't ring true. For instance, when Delia meets Freddy, she introduces herself as Mrs. Delia Mannering. The next time they see each other he makes a big deal about not knowing her Christian name (wasn't he listening or did the author forget?).  In addition, as a lady alone in London, I had a hard time believing she would be so ""neighborly"" to introduce herself to a total stranger. This is not a huge issue, but there were a lot of small issues like this that require suspension of disbelief.I believe this is a debut novel and the author shows promise. The writing was enjoyable to read, the characters were somewhat well developed, but I really didn't like the plot.Spoiler....... If you want to read about an heiress in hiding from a lecherous guardian, supporting herself as a novelist, while the hero smuggles brandy to spy on France with his best friend and fends off his spying mistress who's involved with the guardian who kidnaps the heiress and the hero's sister to be rescued by the hero and best friend who the sister is in love with....whew! Then by all means, this is your book.

AL1SMPJVJR9HY,Willow Star Serenity,"I just finished reading For Better Or For Worse. It is written by Krissy V. It's about a woman who marries the man of her dreams. After getting married, he turns out to be a different man then she thought he was. She becomes scared and confused. She doesn't know who to turn to and she feels alone.Before I talk about how I felt about this book, I want to give Krissy V. a salute for being able to write this book. It must have taken her a lot of courage. I respect and admire that about her. I really enjoyed this book. It through me through some loops, but it kept me on edge through the whole thing. It was dramatic and suspenseful, and it was also sweet and seductive in some points.The only thing I really didn't like about this book was that I felt that the main character was portrayed as a little childish. I get that a lot of abused women start to take on this quality, so I'm not saying this as a bad thing or an insult against the author. I just feel it kind of contradicts here trying to get the jobs she's going for interviews for.I fully recommend many women read this story.

AFIMS5IF73PM0,"J. B. Kramer ""photoburner""","OK here's the story: Yellowstone erupts with no warning whatsoever. The lack of warning in an area so thickly covered with geological instruments is very unlikely. The magma has to move from deep pools, which have been recently mapped, to near the surface. That movement would take months or years and be closely tracked by geological instruments. Plus everyone would notice larger scale earthquakes during this period. We're talking about magma movement of 10 miles or more.This unexpected eruption causes an 11.4 quake in Yellowstone. That is 100 times more powerful than any historical quake and would release almost 1000 times the energy.He then goes on a long boring description of horrific events caused by this. Everything from the death of a couple near Yellowstone to prison riots thousands of miles away. Yawn. He also intersperses this with vile language completely uncalled for by the action. It's like this was written by a 13 year old as he imagines the world. I'm tolerant of strong language when used appropriately in dialog, this is just gratuitous.I think a realistic book based on Yellowstone or the Long Valley Calderas erupting could be a very good read. You could build up tension with increasing quakes and other geological warnings. The eruption could occur and then you could show people at their best and worse in the aftermath. Too bad he didn't write that book.Save your money and just reread the Towering Inferno or some other disaster book.",Just awful,"09 30, 2013",2

A1TW284OGP1GE1,Christina B,"I really enjoyed reading Tevin and Cantia's story in While Angel's Slept. As someone else mentioned, this novel was more focused on internal conflict to the H/h's relationship rather than political intrigue, warring, etc. which were more in the background. Both Tevin and Cantia were easy to like and I sympathized with their varying difficult circumstances. The beginning was appropriately sad, as the heroine is bidding goodbye to her husband only to find out of his demise a short time later. While Tevin was very understanding/thoughtful to Cantia as she goes through the stages of grief, I did have a hard time believing they could fall in love only a few short weeks after Cantia has lost her beloved husband. However, I do know things were different back then and people tended to ""get on with life"" out of sheer necessity a lot quicker than we might approve nowadays. That aside, the love story was sweetly engaging and I was very happy to see these two get their happy ending, because they obviously had a deep affection for each other.

A2UBDYN21RI97X,R. Laney,"My Review A Lost Witch5 starsThis is one of my favorite series of books. I can go back and reread them and be able to enjoy them so much. They are filled with warm, loving characters, some wacky ones, talented, accepting and such a sense of community. A Lost Witch does not disappoint at all.This is the last book in the A Modern Witch series but not the last book with these characters in it. They will be back in Sept. In Witch Central series.Debora is spoiling us with a new book out every 3 months or so. It seems so long at times because we want are fix of good clean loveable characters.If you have not had the chance to read any of the series give yourself a gift and get A Modern Witch book 1.This A Lost Witch is good. One of my favorite of the series. I think I say that each time. Nell is going to turn off the fetching program and finds two words on her computer Help Me! She calls in her friends and family to help when she realizes where and who is saying that.Hannah Kendrick is crazy. She can't meet new people if she sees someone new she breaks down and has to be drugged. It is bad. She has been in put in a home for crazy people. Her doctor is trying to help her but they don't know much. Only some ways to help her avoid attacks.Lauren and Tabitha go in to talk with Dr.Max Torres at Chrysalis House. Max had work before with Tabitha and seen how she can reach out to her patients with a little something else. He is open for them to talk to Hannah if she is willing it might be a really slow process.Hannah sometimes sees the future. She sees two woman come to Chrysalis house to meet her. She welcomes the chance to have someone help her. She handles meeting Tabitha but when she's Lauren she gets attack and is able to runaway from them. Lauren feels bad that she was not able to help her.But Dr. Torres knows that it was a success. Hannah was able to run away usually she had to be drugged after a seizure. Hannah was able to control with Lauren's help for awhile and be able to cope after. That is a positive step that she has not been able to do before.The story draws you into the characters so fast. I did not want to put the book down once I got it. I started reading it within minutes of receiving the book. I love the way the stories go. The characters are my friends and I want to laugh with them again and sometimes cry. See how much the babies are growing and changing. See Marcus happy and enjoying life. I don't want to say goodbye for months more. Never get enough of these characters, these witches and loving friends.I do need to warn you that reading these books might get you addicted to knitting, cookies, Nutella, yarn and wanting more books to read. I have not tried to pickup knitting, weaving or Nutella yet. I do have a small yarn stash all over my house to make hats.

A3UB7X7FZ5VPT2,Margaret Johnson,"I was eagerly anticipating the release of All I Ever Wanted, fully ready to dive into another journey with the D&#8217;Amato boys and their forays into love and the human condition. I was prepared to grin and bear it, grit my teeth, laugh like a lunatic, gasp in surprise/disgust, and question sanity. I was prepared to shout at my Kindle, shake my head in disbelief, and revel in the sinfully delicious sensuality that has become a hallmark for the D&#8217;Amato brothers and their lady loves.What I wasn't&#8217; prepared for was the simplicity of this story.Don&#8217;t get me wrong; the dynamic of the relationship between Zoe Mitchell and Joey D&#8217;Amato is fiercely complex. Both are determined to achieve on their own merits, both are strong and both know what they want out of life. What was refreshing about this story, however, was that there seemed to be less melodrama and more reality.  It&#8217;s perfectly understandable for a couple, who by their own account, cannot let go- of control, the past, their inability to see past the trees of their own forests  but  still manage to fall in love with each other.  I read voraciously, enjoying the lengths that both Zoe and Joey went to have just a sliver of happiness and love.This story was the total opposite of the destruction and drama of its predecessor and with good reason.  Joey seems to be the more rational, the straighter forward of the brothers (his playa ways aside) and it showed in the way he conducted his business. He knew what and who he was in his world.  As a direct contrast, Zoe was all about proving herself to the world. She was focused on making a name for herself on her own sweat and tears. Even though their journey was quite complicated, it wasn't wrought with drama; even Joey&#8217;s run- ins with Catalina, a woman who&#8217;d sought the spoils of being with a D&#8217;Amato, any D&#8217;Amato, wasn't teeming with melodrama. Joey effectively compartmentalized his trysts and his emotions and kept them on a dime.  It would've been easy to let the side pieces run amok but it was far more satisfying to see the drama unfold in a natural, organic manner.  Zoe and Joey&#8217;s misconceptions were all the drama that was required and thankfully, it didn't spiral down the rabbit hole.  Sometimes, all we need in an excellent read is the two characters, hashing out their problems without any outside interference.Although it is a D&#8217;Amato brother&#8217;s book, All I Ever Wanted stands alone. Its tone, its character is far different than any of the other books. There&#8217;s a sense of maturity within the words and that can only be a reflection of growth on both the author and her cadre of characters. As always, Ms. Roberts never fails to bring the truth; her prose grabs you from the first word to the last period. She has the perfect balance of sensuality, love, and human condition. I will continue to be a die-hard fan as long as she continues to write phenomenal, thought provoking work.",Refreshing,"12 10, 2013",5

A33QSO9REE1E7J,K. Meador,"If you are looking for something that is a little bit more than your usual romance, it is this one. Dangerous Paradise has elements of action, suspense and sexual tension involved. I found the story engaging and it is well worth your time for a read.I am trying to figure out where the ""Paradise"" portion of the title fits in except that the location was in the Fiji Island, Hawaii, L.A. and England areas. With survival up front for the main characters in this story I questioned the paradise aspect of this story. Personally, I would have liked to see the female lead a little less naive. How many people actually get to the age of 24 without losing some faith in people around them or would even consider marrying someone much older than she was at that point. The impression I received from the author's description of ""her father's best friend"" was an old man but in reality would only put him in his forties.I thought the author did a good job in development of characters personalities. In fact, Alex's explanation about not wanting to be married again was spot on in my opinion. And then, when circumstances bring into consideration for him about what love and commitment meant to him, it really helped the story move forward.Overall, if you enjoy romantic, suspenseful stories you will not be disappointed with the book.","Bad guys, action, and romance","02 7, 2013",4

The world, viewed through the eyes of a child, makes for an interesting experience. The author will make you feel like you are right beside the characters living the experience for yourself.

I feel for the first time that any words I write to describe this story would be inadequate. First, the storyline is new, historic and deeply interesting. This author is a researcher of immense talent. This is a book that pulls you in, puts you there, really there, so as to feel you are there in this time with these characters. I never knew so much can be known about Canadian history and discovered how it not only paralleled American history, but was and is, intricately interwoven with it. No wonder Americans have a special relationship with Canadians. While I have read many interesting books about the American pioneers and the American industrial revolution, not until this book did I realize Canada and its people were experiencing as much or even more in their country. I will try to patiently await the printing of the next book in this series and look forward to many more stories by this writer. I highly recommend this book.

A14J32LIATP6W7,DaVinciKittie,"The characters in this series are always standouts. Each one is unique and not at all cookie-cutter. While there are some, like Micah, who play a fairly prominent role in every book (I think of him as the AKM shepherd), it's unusual for me to like and identify with EVERY featured couple across a book series.  The first time Malek and Gina are reunited in RotA is a powerful scene and exquisitely written. You can practically feel his aggression and possessive instincts vibrating off the pages, and the shock and bewilderment of their unwitting audience is priceless. The writing is so passionate it gifts the scene with a striking, visceral feel. RotA bristles with emotional intensity and charms with its soul-deep love story. The highs are steamy as hell, and almost manic, while the lows are unbearably intimate and earth-shattering.There are so many memorable scenes that tugged at my heart strings, but one in particular stood out as exceptionally moving. I won't tell you what it is because I don't want to spoil it, but I must have read it five times. The closeness and boundless, selfless friendship and loyalty Ms. Lynne pulls from her characters is just exquisite, and one of the reasons this series is so increasingly habit forming. Another scene is brutally satisfying in its relentless revenge, even for someone as squeamish as I am about bodily mutilation, especially since it's the good guys who get to dish it out and for good reason. If you have not yet started this series, you simply must!Donya Lynne is a ruthless storyteller, in the best possible way, and the AKM books just keep getting better. Even if you know how events will ultimately end up (this is PNR, folks, a happily-ever-after ending ain't exactly a state secret), the story takes you on such a complex, well-crafted emotional ride, you can dive into the story and completely immerse yourself in the deep friendships, loyalty and camaraderie, the passion and despair that are so intimately penned.If you've been waiting for the next Black Dagger Brotherhood, this is it, but with a story arc and featured characters that stand on their own merit and writing that is as complicated and talented as J.R. Ward's without the abrasive, almost gangster style. I dare you to read Return of the Assassin and remain completely unmoved by the events in this book. And to think, this series has so much potential awesome left to explore!New to the series?  Start with Rise of the Fallen and meet the infamous and incorrigible Micah.  *Grin*","A GraveTells Review: Intimate and visceral, RotA will keep you glued to the pages!","10 27, 2013",5

Well what happens when one of them gets a little too close to the current live-in? Trying to hide their lifestyle from their children they are both in for a rude awakening.Kevin and Tori have not been married for long, but Tori decides to surprise Kevin for his 30th birthday to an outing at Puss and Boots, where all his and her, sexual fantasies can be fulfilled. What was supposed to be a fun night, turns out to be one that has a lasting effect on their relationship. Could Tori have had a hidden agenda on going to Puss and Boots? Little do either one of them know that their happy marriage is about to take a major turn.JuJu and Ferrari have been married for years. JuJu is a wealthy beautiful woman, successful from modeling in her younger years (now age 50) she is married to Ferrari who is twenty-years younger. Ferrari is a sexy man by all accounts, one thing JuJu does to keep the spice alive in their marriage is to frequent Puss and Boots. When one particular encounter with another couple seems too intimate, JuJu is intent on making Ferrari pay but when JuJu goes too far things take a turn for the worst.Danielle and Stewart actually met one another a swingers club years ago, fell in love and married. They also happen to be the VIP members at Puss and Boots where they frequent often. The question is are they going to Puss and Boots for the sex or are they going there for another reason?Swing by Miasha is a story of four couples, each one seemingly happy, yet as the saying goes what looks good on the outside, is not necessarily good. Swing is a story of sex and lies. Although, the story flowed well and was quick, it was entirely too short for this particular tale. There is no timeline so the reader is unsure on how much time has passed between some of the scenes. A timeline is important to any story especially with certain types of plots. Not to mention that there are quite a few scenes that made no sense. (Example: the hotel scene.) There needed to be timeline, the story needed to be more descriptive and scenes needed to be played out, not just told matter of fact like. It needed that how, when and why factor.

A3QDZ0LF2AJGYA,rantboi,"First off: I'm not a reader of erotica. It just doesn't interest me. But I am a fan of the author's urban fantasy novels (Spellbent, Shotgun Sorceress, Switchblade Goddess) and since this collection features stories with some of the characters from that series, I decided to give it a shot. I was also very impressed by her previous short story collection, Sparks and Shadows. Sadly, Orchid Carousals did not live up to my high expectations. At all.Here's a story-by-story review:""At the Royal Orchid"" Part I: Not a huge fan of this one. It focuses on Jessie Shimmer (main character from her UF series) and her boyfriend Cooper. This was their first time together. In this story Jessie just turned nineteen and Cooper is thirty-four...and she used to be one of his students. I found that kind of skeevy. Not to mention that Cooper is a pretty boring character, and the sex was boring as well. Nothing interesting or different about it.""At the Royal Orchid"" Part II: This one focuses on Cooper's brother, Warlock, who actually has a personality. Loved him and this story was just different enough to be worth reading. Great ending, too.""Demonized"": Best story in the collection. My favorite! This one focuses on Mother Karen, who gets a surprise visit from an ex. This story is so over-the-top that I actually laughed out loud at the end. That almost never happens to me. Frankly, this is the kind of story I expected this collection to be full of, judging by the sex scenes in Shotgun Sorceress and Switchblade Goddess. Sadly, this great story is an anomaly in this collection.""Biscuit"": Written with a coauthor. First, a disclaimer: I'm not a fan of fiction that needs more than one author to be written. I prefer to read one person's vision, without having to wonder who wrote what. This terrible story did not change my thinking. It starts pretty boring but gets better toward the end, but not enough to make it worth reading. Also, it's about a minor character featured in Spellbent, who I barely remembered. Once I did remember him, I couldn't care less about him. A huge waste of time. I'm assuming the coauthor is a relative or friend of the author, because otherwise I have no idea what this story is doing here. It's especially disappointing since it's the last story featuring characters from her UF novels. A total waste.By this point, we're halfway through the collection. Now let's move on to the other stories:""Fall of Darkness"": Married couple have boring sex in a dystopian world, after some virus infects people. This story did get better toward the end, though it would have been a lot better if the author cut the boring sex scenes and focused on telling an actual story.""In The Wilderness"": A sort of post-dystopian story. At first I wasn't sure about this one, but overall I think it worked. It won me over in the end. Decent story.Part three of this collection is called ""Random Play."" It has essays, poems, and very short stories. The first essay (""Stripping in the Midwest"") was interesting, though I would have probably liked it more if it was a part of a better collection. The poems featured were terrible. The other shorts were decent, but nothing to write home about.Overall, a pretty disappointing read. If you've never read this author before, I highly recommend her UF series. If you want to give her short fiction a shot, you can't go wrong with Sparks and Shadows. The stories in that collection are much better (and hotter) than anything you'll find in this one.I'm being way too generous with my three star rating here, only because of my love for the author's previous work. It would probably be more honest to give it two stars. Maybe erotica readers would have a different reaction. As it stands, I would only recommend this collection to hard-core fans who have to read everything the author has written.",Very disappointing,"08 23, 2013",3

AFKK0OYMVXNVX,"P. Fox ""truth trumps pretty much everything else""","I am amazed by the glowing reviews of what is mostly utter nonsense. While there are many alternative and complementary health practices that have been validated, much of this work is based on junk science.While one page mentions that ionizing radiation can cause cataracts, another page recommends wearing radioactive stones in glasses as a cure for them! Anyone using simple logic should see the contradiction here and recommending home use of radiation is reckless and patently unsafe.Other sections refer to ""liquid oxygen"" dissolved in various solutions which an elementary knowledge of chemistry should warn a reader to beware. Liquid oxygen exists only in a super cooled state and what the author is apparently claiming is that available oxygen molecules are in solution.There is potential that NAC may be of use in the prevention and possibly treatment of senile cataracts but the suggestion that other nutrients such as lutein should not be used are dubious at best. One of the proven methods to reduce cataract risk and progression seems completely ignored, that of simply wearing sunglasses throughout one's lifetime.A true red flag is any work to refers a person to the website of ""Doctor"" Joseph Mercola, a man who despite actual medical training makes absurd health claims mostly to peddle his over priced ""health"" products. Check his record of discipline and interventions by the FDA and others, as well as sites such as Quackwatch.In addition, the book recommends homeopathic medicines which are actually so diluted that they are nothing more than expensive tap water. The idea that water ""remembers"" molecules no longer present is ridiculous according to chemistry and physics. At least they are harmless in themselves, being only water but they may keep a person from getting appropriate treatment so long that great harm can result.Too much of this book is an attempt to paint all traditional medical treatment for cataracts, if not everything else as well, as dangerous and solely motivated by greed. Yes, there are abuses, but hanging crepe instead of presenting a balanced picture of risk vs benefit is neither ethical nor intelligent.There are many sources for legitimate information about cataracts, their treatment and possible side effects of treatments. Do yourself a favor and seek information back by science, not speculation and paranoia.I am developing the early stages of cataracts myself so this subject is quite familiar. Simple good nutrition including antioxidants and supplements known to help protect the eyes under the guidance of real physicians is helping, no progress at all in 18 months since first diagnosis. Personally, I would not put any ""remedy"" in or around my eyes without sound professional advice.",Poor science and dangerous suggestions,"04 3, 2013",1
A1K4G5YJDJQI6Q,Steve C,"This ""book"" is nothing but right wing propaganda claiming wheat is bad for us. It wasn't even worth downloading for free!  While Mr. Morris doesn't mention ""whole grain"" by name it is inferred and he claims it's killing us but people have been eating wheat for hundreds of years so why would it be a ""deadly poison"" suddenly causing all sorts of diseases now?Some people make the same claims for sugar but Morris never mentioned sugar. I suppose a case could be made that nobody should ever eat anything containing sugar or white flour either so why doesn't he warn us about that?There is a theory that humans never evolved to be able to digest wheat since it has to be milled and milling is a fairly recent development. That's not been proved either and Morris doesn't mention it.  Maybe he doesn't believe in evolution either?Fantastic claims require fantastic proof but there is none in this ""book"", just some references to another book entitled ""Grain Brain: The Surprising Truth about Wheat, Carbs, and Sugar--Your Brain's Silent Killers"" by David Perlmutter which is nothing but a collection of conspiracy theories according to the reviews. Mr. Morris is a right wing Republican who works for Fox News on the show ""Fox and Friends"" that is often the target of Saturday Night Live because of the 3 idiots who star on it. One review of the show on IMDB called it ""Early morning masturbation for uneducated, ignorant, right-wing, hillbillies""! The show is described this way: The anchors literally over-simplify every issue without any kind of intellectual depth, and consistently preach bigotry, ignorance, and hate for its White, Christian, rural, uneducated, and southern / western audience"".  This book is just more of the same idiocy from a right wing nut wanting to rant. I guess he doesn't get to say enough nonsense on the show so he branched out to ""books"" although I wouldn't call 35 pages at one page per chapter a book.It would be interesting to know how Mr. Morris feels about flu shots?  On one hand his ""book"" sounds a lot like the opponents of the shots who claim they are dangerous, unproven and have no benefits and are just a way for the medical establishment to make more money by scaring everyone into getting the shots when they try to spread panic every year about impending flu epidemics.  On the other hand he might be for them since they are another way for rich Republicans to make even more money by scaring everyone into getting the shots so the value of their medical stocks will go up.

Just to touch you.&#8221;Once in a blue moon, I find myself starting a book with absolutely no prior knowledge of its storyline or the themes in it, excited by the possibilities and lack of expectations, and while it is always a gamble, the mere fact that this particular book was penned by an author who has never let me down, made me feel like it was a safe bet from the very beginning. What I didn&#8217;t know was that this story would end up being my undoing from the moment I realised what it was about.Let it be known that nothing spikes my interest like a tale of forbidden romance between a teacher and a student, its inherent illicitness and lack of control being something I am inexplicably drawn to in the books I read, the greatest allure perhaps lying in the fact that, while morally despicable in real life, in fiction, we are allowed to mentally participate in these scenarios, and even root for them. But, as appealing as I find the mere idea of them, I personally also see them as extremely &#8216;hard sells&#8217; in most cases. I honestly never know whether they would creep me out or make me tingle in all the right places, but I should have known that Ella Frank would have kicked it up a notch and set my skin on fire. This is a story that is so well-rounded, so masterfully assembled, every component fitting perfectly into the overall storyline and giving us one of the most intense, tantalizing, emotionally charged romances to feed our wicked fantasies.&#8220;I looked at her&#8212;she looked at me. My ending, staring right at me from the very beginning.&#8221;Grayson McKendrick is a history teacher, in his early thirties, a man whose past remains fairly elusive for the purposes of this story, apart from the fact that he has spent a large portion of his adulthood leading a rather nomadic life, traveling the world, until his father&#8217;s frail health brings him back home. He battles with conflicting feelings of anger and helplessness, expecting the worst to happen in the immediate future, but frustrated with himself for being unable to do anything to prevent it. His fairly quiet life comes to a standstill the moment a blue-eyed siren walks into his classroom and mischievously smiles at him, challenging his every resolve, his every belief, and from that moment onwards, Grayson&#8217;s life becomes a daily struggle to resist temptation and his body&#8217;s primal reactions to someone he knows he cannot and should not have.&#8220;Temptation had come to visit, and her steely determination would likely destroy us both.&#8221;Addison Lancaster is a popular girl, a high school senior whose traumatic past has cut her childhood short and made her into a woman who escapes her grief and overwhelming guilt by pursuing perfection and excellence in the things she can control in her life. But her pursuit of perfection is a race she can never win, her immaculate appearance only camouflaging the broken young woman hiding inside her, one in dire need of love and acceptance, but who only ever receives criticism and blame for the mistakes she never made. The Addison that the world sees is flawless, determined, ambitious, unemotional, a very different woman to the little girl still hiding behind her defensive walls. The only signs of her inner struggle are her little obsessive compulsions such as having to always hear the tick tock of a clock or her mental counting, acts that calm her nerves and warn off her anxiety when memories or external influences unsettle her.&#8220;With him the ticking had stopped.&#8221;When Addison lays eyes on her new history teacher, she is immediately attracted to him and she shamelessly pursues him any chance she gets. In a very rare reverse power dynamic in the context of a forbidden romance, young Addison is the one who sets the pace of their evolving relationship, her relentless determination to seduce him and make him admit his reluctant attraction to her is the element that makes this scenario so unique and addictive. Their age difference quickly disappears before our eyes, all we can see is the temptress rather than a woman half this man&#8217;s age, and as a result, their every interaction assumes an aura of delicious illicitness.&#8220;I&#8217;ll teach you how to come with a man inside you. Not a boy, Addison, a man.&#8221;But while Addison is the very thing that could destroy Grayson&#8217;s entire life, he is the first person in hers who manages to ground her, calm her nerves, make her feel safe and loved. No part of this taboo love affair is glorified or presented as the &#8216;the right way&#8217; &#8211; we are continuously aware of how volatile and morally questionable this scenario is from the very beginning, and ultimately, the ending fits these given characters.&#8220;You&#8217;re going to be the death of me.&#8221;Life is full of ironies, because with him, I&#8217;d never felt more alive.Do not be afraid by this book&#8217;s enigmatic blurb, do not be afraid to surrender your senses to this strikingly written love story that will ignite your every nerve ending and make you feel a myriad of different emotions. It somehow taps into all the taboos that make our kinks run rampant, and still manages to move us deeply and even shatter our hearts on occasion. I read this book in one sitting, in what felt like one single breath, and I adored every moment spent with Addison and Grayson. It has everything I always dream of finding in a forbidden student/teacher romance, but it is a love story first and foremost, and as such, I cannot recommend it enough to all the hopeless romantics out there.&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t wrong. No&#8212;it was just misunderstood.&#8221;",A PERFECT TALE OF FORBIDDEN ROMANCE&#8230;,"04 10, 2014",5

A8CJLP0V6OQZJ,Lorie,"If you haven&#8217;t read Jani Kay yet, WRITE HER NAME DOWN. I guarantee you will NOT want to miss out on the sexy, arrogant, magnetic, captivating, and uber alpha male characters she has created in Lost in France.Holy heck was I lost IN THIS BOOK!!! When I opened the first page, I really had no clue what to expect. I knew nothing except that I love love love the cover. Yes, I read the blurb, but it&#8217;s still hard to tell if it&#8217;s going to be winner or a loser. Never in a million years did I think it was going to be this AWESOME and CAPTIVATING!!&#8220;Life is not measured by the number of breaths you take but by the moments that take your breath away.&#8221;When Rebecca leaves Australia and heads to France in order to escape her past, the last thing she ever expected was to find not one, but two men that are desperate to have her. On the plane, Rebecca meets Alain the suave and extremely gorgeous Frenchman. (All I have to say is that I have never flown overseas in first class, but evidently I am seriously missing out on First Class hospitality!) Once she sets foot on French soil, Rebecca meets her new boss, Maxwell Grant.The two men could not be more opposite. Alain is a gentleman. Maxwell is, well&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. an arrogant ass. Both are ridiculously alluring in their own way. Alain is sexy and romantic. Maxwell is magnetic and rough. Alain is from aristocratic bloodlines. Maxwell is an American. But both agree that what they want is Rebecca, and they have no intention of letting the other win.The chase that ensues to win Rebecca is breathtaking to say the least. Rebecca is whisked from Paris New to York to Versailles, from chateau to hotel, from Porsche to Maserati to motorcycle. Alain is charming and sexy. Maxwell is arrogant and smooth. And, I don&#8217;t envy the choice Rebecca has to make. Yes, Alain seems perfect, but even though Maxwell is a certifiable A-S-S there&#8217;s more to him than you see on the surface. Things happen and circumstances change, but will Rebecca ever find a man to call &#8220;mine&#8221;?Jani has created a different kind of alpha male that I am falling madly in love with &#8211; both Alain and Maxwell. I can&#8217;t quite put my finger on what makes them different from the other rich, gorgeous, sexy as hell, dominating men. Whatever it is, Jani has discovered the secret. I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s set in France or because Jani is a great writer (I think it&#8217;s the latter), but THE SEX IS HOT! She sure knows how to build anticipation. I seriously could not turn the pages fast enough. The story is just as captivating as the men. And, Jani&#8217;s writing style just adds to the awesomeness of it all.My first big surprise happened when I started Chapter 3. It is the ONE thing a book can have that will make me fall in love with it. You&#8217;re probably wondering what it is&#8230;. dual POV!!! I seriously love dual POV stories. It ranks up there with hot, well-written sex scenes (which this has too, so double points for Jani!). It&#8217;s not a full dual POV book, but what I love is that we get Alain&#8217;s POV when it&#8217;s needed. This really gives the reader a whole new perspective on the story.On a side note&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. I&#8217;ve been thinking&#8230;. it&#8217;s called the Firebird Trilogy, so what&#8217;s the deal with the name???? Most series names have meaning so naturally (maybe not for you, but for me, yes) I was curious. Firebird is briefly mentioned in the book but not explained so now I&#8217;m very intrigued. And because of the person that mentioned the word, I&#8217;m dying even more to know the significance.Lost in France isn&#8217;t Jani&#8217;s first book. Surprised? I was. I had no idea. I have no clue how I missed this bit of information. But you bet I&#8217;m going to grab her first book, Open Your Eyes.I. NEED. BOOK 2. NOW. I can&#8217;t wait to see what happens next. And, it doesn&#8217;t look like I&#8217;ll need to wait that long because January 2014 appears to be the magical date.",You will want to fly first class after reading this........,"11 30, 2013",5

Kate is a successful wedding planner, but she has a fear of flying, and is klutzy - with an unfortunate habit of spilling drinks all over herself whenever she gets nervous or emotional. Then she meets Drew. And Luke. But she doesn't know that she's met Luke,as he's the twin brother of Drew. So which brother did she kiss? If that wasn't confusing enough for her, Drew is the groom in Kate's next big wedding, and she's horrified that she played tonsil hockey with her client.Luke knows he should tell Kate that he was the guy she kissed, but events always seem to conspire against him. Each time he plans to come clean, another spanner is thrown in the works. He enlists Drew to help clear things up, but Drew - unintentionially - ends up confusing things even more.There are some great supporting characters in this book - from Lauren, Drew's fiance, who is definitely not a typical daddy's little rich girl, to Miles, who is fantastically over the top in the way only a gay wedding planner can be.

Her grandpa is a scientist and an inventor who makes wonderful machines. One day when her grandparents were sleeping Abigail crept up to the attic where she found all sorts of things including a bicycle and an old book containing pictures from places all around the world. On the book's last page was a phrase that if repeated three times the magical tour would begin. Not being able to resist, Abigail soon finds she is flying on the bicycle over the Amazon jungle where she sees the Amazon river, a toucan, a jaguar cub, monkeys, and a little Indian boy named Nuka with whom she shares her bicycle. Nuka take Abigail to his village where she meets all his family and friends, but as it grows dark she must return home on her magic bicycle - where her imaginative grandparents welcome back Abigail and the secrets of her adventure.The marriage of words and images is just right for this nice little story that celebrates curiosity, imagination, and the love of discovering new ideas, new place, new culture, and new people.

ACL6H8Q17XQPN,Jenn,"First off, this is the first book review I've ever written and I've read hundreds and hundreds of books.  I usually like the reader to develop their own opinions based on personal taste, however I feel such a strong dislike of this book that I had to say something.I'm completely shocked that this book has so many positive ratings and in complete awe that it would have received any awards at all.  Not only are the sentences and thoughts choppy and incomplete, but had she used any more One.Word.Sentences. my brain would have exploded.  I felt like I was caught in a textravaganza between two high school girls. The story itself I felt was a slight rip off of the Billionaire Series by Melody Anne, but you know what they say &#34;Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery&#34;.  And although the plot was much the same, sadly the caliber of this story was WAY under par.  I wanted to like Lucy, the female lead, but I just couldn't.  The writer made her flaky and incapable of coherent thought process.  In one chapter she decides that beyond all reason and after meeting him only once she's in love with the guy.  Then about two chapters later she asks herself the question &#34;Could I be falling in love?&#34; Um, I thought you already decided that. And don't even get me started on the &#34;hero&#34;.  For an all important billionaire the guy went from alpha male to uber mushy in almost an instant, which made it way too unbelievable, even for a fairy tale romance.  I mean what kind of alpha male suddenly starts simpering about how much he's been hurt in the past, and how, after only one night together, one dance and about two other face to face meetings decides that he'll forego all his other previous notions that all women are gold diggers and throw caution to the wind AFTER fighting with his aging Grandfather during the entire book for doing the exact same thing?  And you're given the impression that his family has been very well to do for some time now, thanks to dear old Grand dad's hard work all those years, but Antonio (the &#34;hero&#34;) comes across incredibly unrefined.  During a drive he asks Lucy &#34;Do you want on some music?&#34;  Uh...Wouldn't a high class billionaire/alpha male decided he wanted music and just play it?  After all, they're in HIS car.  Maybe he decides to be a gentleman...wouldn't he ask &#34;Would you like some music?&#34;  All the mannerisms and technique that would have been taught to a born billionaire just wasn't there and it gave his character I very billionaire-impostor feel. And I nearly gagged at the ending. She's the WEDDING COORDINATOR. She set up and organized the entire event, she's been on site the entire time, but suddenly when the hero shows up there is a puppy tied to a tree a short distance away, suspiciously holding the ring box?  Really?  That's the best you could do?  WHAT DID ANYTHING HAVE TO DO WITH THE PUPPY?!?!?  The whole thing left me extremely sad for having wasted my time.  The only reason I finished it was so I could be sure before writing this review that the book had absolutely no redeeming qualities.  I was right.  I wanted a romance novel that made me fall in love with love but this book made me want to just shoot Lucy and put us both out of our misery.  This was supposed to be about a grown woman and it felt more like a 16 year old inhabiting her body.  I'm completely  saddened to learn there is an entire series of these books, none of which I will be reading.  I urge you for sanity's sake to stay away as well.  Go find a book that might hold your interest. This isn't one of them.",Shock and Awe... *contains Spoilers*,"04 8, 2014",1

A26URS4J3HUJ2W,CherriesInTheSnow,"""What we've got is special; we know each other, really know each other, from the very first chapter. We've skipped a few pages and lost our grasp on each other but she's here, I'm here. We got a second chance at first love."" Deacon ""Second Chance Hero""5 stars for ""Second Chance Hero"" by Rebecca Sherwin. Loved this story !! Ms Sherwin has given us a debut novel that is about family, friendship, love, lust, loss, and second chances. I was hooked from the first chapter.Jenna Rivera and Deacon Reid have been best friends since childhood. Their families live across the lane from each other, they share family dinners and holidays. They also share the belief that Jenna and Deacon are destined to be together. One Christmas Jenna and Deacon find themselves alone on the beach, where one unexpected kiss changes everything between them. They both run from the confusing feelings they experience in that kiss, their friendship fractured.5 1/2 years later Jenna is living in London where she settles for a ""safe"" relationship with Kip {a stockbroker}. Deacon who has suffered the lost of his father and Jenna on the same night {the night on the beach} avoids forming any emotional attachments. His life, revolves around running his father's business and his casual sexual relationships.Circumstances bring Deacon and Jenna together again some 5 years later, what follows is their struggle to reclaim the friendship they lost and a second chance at exploring the possibilites of love they did not have the courage to declare that night long ago on the beach. They try to work through the anger, mistrust and hurt feelings that has torn their friendship apart and turned them into different people.I found myself rooting for Deacon, he is sure of what he wants, he knows that he broke Jenna's heart that night on the beach, and he is fighting with everything he has and is to prove his loves for her. He wants a second chance to prove he can be the man she needs and deserves. Deacon is emboldened by his belief that his father always knew he and Jenna belonged together, it is his guiding light and he will stop at nothing to win Jenna back {sighs}.Jenna on the other hand is so afraid of the all consuming love she has always felt for Deacon. She cannot face being rejected. She is still so angry and hurt that can't let go of her relationship with Kip. She uses it like a sheild too keep Deacon at a distance and off balance. She settles for a relationship with Kip that is safe, a relationship that is void of passion and the burning love she feels for Deacon. I was exasperated with Jenna, I wanted to shake some sense into her..The sexual tension between Jenna and Deacon jumps off the page. While they are trying to resolve the mistrust, anger and hurt feelings, they cannot help but give into the passion, they feel for each other. Can they learn to put the past behind them? Can Jenna forgive Deacon for breaking heart? Will Jenna be able to admit to herself that what she feels for Kip is not love? Will Deacon have his Second Chance to be Jenna's Hero ?? You'll have to read ""Second Chance Hero"" by Rebecca Sherwin, to find the answers..",Second Chance Hero by Rebecca Sherwin,"10 4, 2013",5

I am so emotionally distraught with this 3rd book, with the ""MIND GAMES"" and even though we've been been forewarned HOW MANY TIMES of watching out for these manipulation by the emotionally retarded genes these men of this stupid family carry, she falls AGAIN for Zane's  stupid manipulation despite her ""supposed"" love for Ace, I just want to know how can she do that to him!I don't want to give up on the author because she writes an excellent story and makes it so real, I will buy the 4th book because I have hope, but I pray there is a redeeming quality in there somewhere, but, sorry this book really pissed me off!This book bruised the story a LOT!Makes you wonder if Chloe is somehow messed up just like her biological father and brother and is helping them and is manipulating Ace to get what Stephan and her father wants!!!

So many times throughout this short story I had to read and re read words, sentences and paragraphs trying to figure out what the author meant to say.  Something as simple as using he or she for who is speaking at the time was used wrong and the errors rapidly escalate from there with whole sentances and paragraphs not being distinguishable.  It actually seemed like it was intentional all the errors because I can't believe an author could come up with such a good abdl story and not show pride in it by making sure the sentences made sense. There were way too many errors!!!!  Would have given the story 5 stars if not for the sloppy writing.

A1K5MKPPOKZSRP,Amazon Customer,"Grace Burrowes is an auto-buy author for me and once I have her latest in hand, all other activity ceases.  I always love to see old characters pop up again in this universe that she has created.  I haven't seen heroines with disabilities very often in romance, yet Burrowes handles Morgan's hearing issues with sensitivity and dignity.  I felt a great deal of respect for Morgan. She was not a helpless, waif-like creature and in fact she had a hand in helping her hero, Archer, solve the mystery that'd had him at a loss for quite some time.  And while Morgan's condition caused her to face certain harsh realities about human nature, it was clear that she was not an object of pity. She didn't bemoan her past and she tried to make every moment count in the present.  However once she met Archer, you could feel her sadness as she felt that her hearing issues would truly be a limiting factor in terms of her having a love of her own and a family.  Watching the meddling &#34;Duke&#34; up to his usual machinations and overprotective, stand-in big brother, Valentine Windham, definitely brought a light-hearted feel to this novella.  And Archer, at turns slick and mischievous as his job demands and loving, tender, hanging on to Morgan's every word, was a wonderful hero and match for Morgan. Since this was a novella, things happen between Archer and Morgan rather quickly.  As I love Burrowes' writing so much, of course I wanted it stretched out a great deal longer.  But, it was a satisfying quick read - fine as a stand-alone but much richer after you've been introduced to all of the wonderful Windhams.",An amazing heroine,"11 5, 2013",4

Well, I sure didn't know anything about those species.

My mom actually have a pond full of shrimps at the countryside, which she grows and sells to the market. She never entertained the thought of putting those little shrimps in an aquarium. Now with thus helpful book from Gordon Monock, mom and I learned a lot about shrimps and how to go about breeding them.The book is divided into several parts, which include:* selecting the best freshwater shrimps* setting the aquarium* purchasing the ideal shrimps as well as their tank mates* feeding / breeding the shrimps and maintaining the aquarium* the precautions or things to avoid when selecting / breeding shrimpsplus more!The above mentioned topics along with other important notes are what most aqua hobbyists need to know and remember. Thank you Gordon Monock for coming up with this informative venture.  Now, thanks to you, I can buy an aquarium for my kids so we can all start taking care of shrimps as pets.

A1Z2CGA2RF5A5Q,scottkad,"I want to be honest and provide my feedback without being cruel.  I've read a lot of fiction similar to this, and this was not very good.  It is supposed to be from the perspective of a 40 something mother of a college student and she comes across as a 21 yr old herself.  Secondly, this book holds every single fiction cliche out there- falls in love after 3 days, woman tries to run away in a self-sacrificing manner, woman continually makes obnoxious/unrealistic decisions in an attempt to showcase her freedom and intelligence (which quite honestly, make her and all women look like an idiot), runs into a dead end while being chased by the bad guy, trusts everyone, etc.  I seriously found myself rolling my eyes every chapter.Also, I couldn't quite grasp the 'sexiness' of the Sheriff.  All I could picture was the cops from that TV show Reno 911 and smokey the bear wearing a Sheriff's hat saying &#34;only you can prevent forest fires.&#34;  No joke.

A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX,"Vanessa ""The Jeep Diva""","There is a mediocre story hidden somewhere in the numerous pages of Storm Season and Nicola Cameron's preaching better eco/green living and the three men and their numerous bouts of sex. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love a smutty good erotic read. In fact erotic romance is my preferred genre. These guys just get down and dirty quick with a foretold insta-mating that equals insta-love all around. Perhaps the love story was also lost in the &#8220;watch the size of the carbon foot print you are leaving&#8221; spew. It appears that the author wants to get a message across that we humans should treat the earth better. Her chosen method of message delivery was a romance novel. The story gets lost in her live cleaner now message.Don't even get me started on the total disrespect towards the 11 men who lost their lives on that horrible day. I forced myself to finish reading the book just to see if she ever made any mention of the human lives lost, or the family and friends of those men who lost a loved one. NOTHING, she never mentioned it. I felt that if she could use the tragic event of the Transocean Deepwater Horizon to give her story some meat (which the story gets lost in the message she wants you to grasp) she could have made some small mention of the human lives lost.",Storm Season,"11 5, 2013",1

A3TGY3ANGBNK7C,"Cocktails and Books ""Shannon""","Wicked Designs is a historical romance with elements of suspense.  Emily Parr has recently been orphaned.  Her uncle, Albert Parr, has charge of her and access to the money left to her by her parents.  Unfortunately, Uncle Albert does not make good investments and has found himself heavily in debt to several people.  He bargains away one of his debtors, Thomas Blankenship, with the promise of Emily's hand in marriage.  Emily has been subjected to Blankenship's pawing and is unaware of her uncle's deal with the devil.  She is determined to make a good match to get away from her uncle and live life on her own terms.Emily's plans to snag a generous husband are thwarted when she is abducted by the League of Rogues.  Godric St. Laurent, Duke of Essex is also owed money by Albert Parr.  He has decided to ruin Emily as a way to retaliate against her uncle.  However, Emily is not your average wilting flower.  She is courageous, smart, and resourceful.  I fell in love with her character.  The author writes so eloquently about her from her grief over the loss of her parents to her hopes to win Godric's heart.  I immediately empathized with her and admired her determination to be the captain of her own destiny.  Her escape attempts were hilarious.I rode the fence on Godric's character.  There were times where I liked him, but I couldn't understand how he could ruin Emily's life for his own sense of satisfaction.  I did grow to really like him and by the end of the book I was firmly in his corner.  I think I turned the corner when he chased her down and brought her back to his home.  The author revealed his story layer by layer and included dialogue that revealed his self-talk.  I absolutely love it when authors let you peep in and see what the male characters are thinking.  I wish I could do that in real life.The secondary cast of characters added depth to the story.  I loved all the rogues, and I am hopeful that this is the first book in a series.  There were various hints at the stories of the other rogues and possible romances, but I would like to see each one find love.  You could feel their camaraderie and genuine affection for each other.This story was the best of romance, friendship, and love.  It was a quick, easy read that put a smile on my face.Reviewed by Michelle for Cocktails and Books",Reviewed for Cocktails and Books,"02 2, 2014",5

The authors give a detailed analysis on taxes, policies in education, owning a home, and the results of affirmative action. Horowitz and Perazzo discuss the severe damage that was caused to the lives of the poor, concluding that it is beyond repair. In addition, they present arguments on incompetence, ignorance, and corruption of Democratic politicians and its horrifying results. This analysis is a powerful argument about the damage caused to America's poor minorities, with little hope of repair in the future. Shocking, scary, and extremely thought-provoking. Although I would have liked to read more information and facts pertaining to the presenting argument, the reader will certainly be thinking for a long time about this powerful debate and findings that were presented.

Ive been reading a lot of mysteries the past few weeks (which I love) but sometimes I need to read something really light and fluffy just to break it up a bit.. &#34;Mail Order Love fit the bill perfectly.We start off in a sort of cinderella story. Ellie, our heroine is working her fingers to the bone &#34;paying for her keep&#34; at her sister in law, Ursula's home after losing every member of her family to typhoid. Ursula soon tires of her presence, and to pay off some personal debt, she arranges a marriage for Ellie with an greasy, lecherous man named Mr. Gergmins. He is a villain Dickens would be proud of. The man is so amphibiously greasy you expect him to leave a slime trail behind him like a slug.I'm not sure if it was meant to be comical but I found myself chuckling.Anyway, to secure her escape, Ellie places an ad as a housekeeper in a newspaper. An old woman answers the ad, sends her a ticket and then informs her grandson (who looks after her and the ranch) that she ordered him a mail order bride as a present and could he go pick her up at the train station...I won't give away the rest of the story but it is a very sweet, very clean read, enjoyable and suitable for all audiences. I saw nothing in it that would offend even the most sensitive of readers.I appreciated the fact that the heroine was someone we could relate to. She wasn't drop dead gorgeous, nor ugly. Just normal. She had a sweet personality and was easy to like. The romance was not instant but developed slowly which was realistic.Why 4 stars and not 5? I would like to feel just a bit more UMPH.

Maybe someone suggested it be your mantra at some point because words were always being hurled at you? Nit picking, constant nagging, and sometimes a little cruel? Yeah, I know I've been there.So the heroine in this story gets this kind of thing a lot. She's always being picked on. I don't know if I'd call it bullying, but it's still an emotional warfare that she manages to suppress, but it affects her more than many people will ever know. Cam lives in a shell. She can be kind of cold. She throws herself into her work because frankly, it's all she has. She's been dating someone for awhile until he too throws some cold words at her. Bombshell after bombshell, right before her sister's wedding and having to face her family who also loves to nitpick.I'll be honest. I wasn't set out to like Cam in the beginning. She was kind of cold. I wondered how in the world I was going to connect to this woman. Was I ever surprised when I found a deep connection. It started when Cam went home to her family. Let's just say I understand why she's somewhat shut off emotionally. I don't blame her. Not one bit. I found out exactly why this book title has the word dysfunctional in it.Let's talk about Troy, the hero. He's a man that has a bit of baggage. He's known Cam and her family for years and is now somehow sucked into her sister's little scheme to keep the family off Cam's back. I love stories like these, when it all starts out as pretend and turns completely around to become the real thing. Neither Cam or Troy expect things to escalate the way they do.I love them together. Friends, who have always seen a little more to the other than they let on to anyone. Troy helps Cam open up, loosen up and he finds a way to her heart. This story is filled with quirky characters and some laugh out loud moments. It's also high on the emotions, especially when I could relate to situations and feelings, mainly with Cam. She's one that kind of grows on me. Not everyone may understand her unless they've gone through something similar. She's very hard to read otherwise. And that's what makes a story so great- understanding a much deeper level with characters. The author has created a believable story with an outcome I hoped would pan out well for Troy and Cam.If you're looking for a story that has the potential to tug on your heartstrings and make you laugh as well, I recommend The Dysfunctional Test.Originally posted at Long and Short Reviews",Good Reading,"10 11, 2013",4

The more I read the more I started to wonder if the story would end with a good happy ending or a sad emotional dispute. The author of this book used a great amount of detail to explain how the characters involvement would take the story into a new direction by the end of the book. This book not only has adventure, bribery, and a touch of romance in it, but it gives an insightful moment to the reader that says anything in life is possible.  People don&#8217;t always realize that the small things that we do in life can make a big difference in how we end our journey.

The information he reveals is quite interesting to anyone who reads the New Yorker and has seen Malcolm Gladwell speaking on BookTV and wondered &#34;Why does anyone think he is a good writer?&#34; I always thought Gladwell's style was mediocre at best and found his logic, what there was of it, to be muddle-headed. My background is in philosophy and the law so I tend to judge writers on clarity of thought and good logical arguments.

I did manage to finish Book 1 but for this second book, I couldn't force myself to go any further than the end of Chapter 5 (which is almost halfway), but I was really pushing it to give it that much of a chance.  Authors usually improve as their series progress but that is not the case here. I guess I must have downloaded Book 1 because it was free and I liked the title, but I bought and paid for Book 2 at the same time based on reading the glowing reviews here....Big Mistake!!I do not like to slate an author and I guess there are people who like this stuff, but I found it hideously dated and lazy. The sad thing is that it could have been a good series but I really think the author should read some urban fantasy or something like SM Reine's The Descent series.  I'm not saying her books should be exactly like this, but it's an example of how ""demon"" stuff has moved on these days. ""Satanic Cult"" just screams old-fashioned.  Satan appearing in the dirty pot of water in the sink, Five Pointed Star Construction (gosh I wonder what that could be a front for...), the transferring of evil by touching of people's shoulders at the town meeting, the supposedly sexy neoprene suit with the lumpy cooling packs sewn in - eh, hello!

A2JYAO7G2LWH25,Logic101,"Pickup Etiquette was an interesting, and rather inspiring read.  If you're just an average Jack the author describes that provided you have some good ethics, and can be honest you have opportunity among the hot landscape of fine ladies.I would describe something along this.  NFL teams usually don't go for it on 4th down, or if they do it's when it's usually in scoring distance, but stats would suggest if the teams would go for it they would probably pick-up the necessary yards for the 1st down.  I'm a divorced guy who has had to come around to dating, and the what's necessary to pickup the fine female.  Now, if I only can come around to the notion of ""going for it"", I too would probably pick-up the gal of my deepest desires more often.  So the suggestion he makes seems like a good one.The book relates that you should use eye contact, as a yard stick of determining your next move.  I can identify with some of this, and certainly am willing to implement some of these thought out suggestions as I move along the landscape of dating again.  That's just one tip, and there is a 1/2 dozen or so other witty ideas that may have the girls fawning over you.The author writes as if he has a strong background in all the etiquette he is laying down.  I am confident he does as his plans seem very realistic for any guy and yes even those of us who are are average.  I'm not 100% convinced these will score a trophy everytime, but he gives you the courage that often is forgotten.  In addition he gives you the idea that where so many fail to pursue you must!

I usually can't wait to get a hold of the next book and when I finally do, I then feel sad it has ended.Having raved about the first two books especially the 2nd, this 3rd and last book was not as exciting as the first two were, it lacked some heat and steam as far as Jax's emotions are concerned. Somehow he gave me an impression he's not emotionally invested in. He's way too cryptic and always seem preoccupied. It seems the only times he's in the zone with Ivy is when they're having sex. Half the time he just disappears even in the most crucial times when Ivy needed him the most. His strong desire for revenge almost eclipsed his desire and love for Ivy.

AENBPJNEG049B,Diana G. Kuruc,"I enjoyed the latest book written by Mr. Griffel. I'm not Jewish so his Jewish summer vacation opened a door to a particular type of vacation new to me. Mr. Griffel characters are very real. He has a knack of capturing the real person.For the most part, I think I would have enjoyed the ""Catskill"" experience, minus a few of the kids. I liked the idea of summer camp for the whole family, with daddy coming up on Friday nights and partaking in the family scene i.e. father son ball games, poker with the guys, and taking the misses out on Saturday nights at the Casino. I was caught up in the story. I felt David's pain as new kid on the block, but I really didn't like him very much. I found him to be a somewhat indulged, self-centered only child, which made him kind of whimpy. He is on the verge of developing into a man, but I can see  he has a long way to go. At every point when he could mature a little, he flunkes. He's still an immature kid, with not much insight, but I guess he's like most kids his age. I hope the next book finds him developing some character. I didn't find him to be the type of kid I would emulate, or enjoy being around. But, nevertheless, I really enjoyed the story. I should be talking more about Mr. Griffel skill as a writer, I'm hung up on thinking about David and what a jerk he turned out to be.",created for me a culturally different childhood,"09 28, 2013",4

A1J0R4BQMKXZMF,Heat10,"This is the continuation to Mistress. I know people don't like sequels; however, there's no what just happened cliffhangers in this series, just excellent writing and a great story about heartache, redemption, and love.Keisha isn't perfect, we found that out in Mistress and Commitment. However, Keisha has changed. Jayson is part of the reason for her change. Jayson and Keisha deal with their jealousy about the other men and women in both of their lives.In the beginning Keisha was doing everything to please Jayson, she was in love with him and opened her heart to him after his return. Jayson was guarded and angry at times. He sets up rules and so does she for their relationship, but they sort of break them along the way.Keisha grows so much in this book. You find yourself rooting for her and Jayson.  At times you wonder if they're mature enough to make it. They both seemed to be missing the point of what a true friendship and love is about in a real relationship. Just when you are about to write one of them off the author reels you back in.The author plays a cat and mouse game with your emotions.  You are left wondering if they will let the past destroy what they were building.  There is so much tension and love in their relationship you just don't know what's going to happen next.Great book. A masterful job by the author! You will be elated, sad, angry, and then feel like you want to cry while reading some scenes.  All of those emotions and then some will occur for you in this book.Pros:Jayson. He's manly yet vulnerable at times. Angry and loving. He's alpha and protective of Keisha, which makes him even more sexy. He loves him some Keisha.Keisha. She becomes a woman in this book, not in the sense of sexually, but she starts to find her own self worth. The makeup and false identity comes off. Keisha is a sweet and strong woman. Not perfect, but she gets it now.Well written. The best so far.Sexy love scenes. There's angry sex and love making in this one.Drama. A crazy ex.Cons:Cons for some, because we don't get to see her as a mother until the next book. However, this book is about Keisha and Jayson changing to finally get to a place to be married. With that I can see some viewing having to read a 3rd book a con. At least you get a whole lot of book with this author for a minimal price.",Just..Wow! Emotional roller coaster ride!

The Settlers achieves this.If you've read the excerpted short stories Onyx and Soma, you're already acquainted with what to expect from The Settlers.  But now, not only do you get to see how Micah and Tasneem fit into the larger narrative, you get to meet a whole new cast of characters.  You'll experirence their pain, their joy, and the sacrifices they have to make for the promise of a better future in space.Structurally, The Settlers is different than most novels.  It is composed of vignettes which at times are interwoven with the larger plot, and at others merely glimpses into the lives of the first people to call space home.  Their situations are relatable which make the storytelling all the more strong.  This is possibly why The Settlers succeeds so well in delivering a memorable and timeless story.We find, that even in the future, many miles away from the only home we have, we remain human.  We suffer from jealousy, hatred, love, pain, regret, and even fail to learn from past mistakes.  No matter how many problems we solve with technology, or destructive ideals we shed, we can't escape ourselves.  We can't escape being human.If you enjoy science fiction that tackles subjects that lie beyond the surface, then The Settlers is for you.  I'm looking forward to the next installment, as I'm sure you will be too.",Stories that will stay with you,"02 16, 2013",5

A1O00HPJ60OU2K,Amazon Customer,"Today's post is on Lethal Believers: The Innocents by G.M. Baker. It is 215 pages long and is published by MasterKoda Publishing. The cover has the title and author name in white against a gray background with smoke and some kind of cross on it. The intended reader is someone who likes thrillers I think but I will get into that in my review. There is language, sex, talk of rape and child molestation, and violence in this book so beware. It is told from varying view point but I will get into that in my review as well. There Be Spoilers Ahead.From Goodreads- Malachi Danta-Mercadel, retired INTERPOL/Secret Service rails against the Mantid Tranquil organization bent on vesting a form of paranormal revenge, given Danta's handiwork for exposing Mantid's illicit operations. However, a certain intervention, with an intricate agenda, leaves both Danta and Mantid Tranquil not only at decisive odds, but also at the distinct disadvantage of an unsettled Myth.Review- I feel bad about the review I am about to give. I was given an ecopy of this book to review for free and I am not going to give this book a good review. I cannot recommend this book. The plot makes no sense. I had and have no idea what was going on in the book. I do not know who the real killer was and what makes this worse is that I do not care. I do not care about any one of the characters. I did not feel that the characters were real. The dialogue was forced, confusing, and in some places just down right bizarre. There are time jumps that are unexplained and just serve to confuse the reader even more. Danta is, I think, supposed to be interesting and very smart but he was fake and boring. I was bored for some of this novel because it was un-understandable. I think that this was to be a thriller but it was too all over the place to be anything. At the end of the novel when the person convicted of the killings is hanged there is a weird paranormal something that I am not sure why it was in the novel. About the point of view; Baker goes from third person close to third person omniscient back to third person close again all within the same sentence. The other main character goes from being teacher to victim to killer all without the reader getting any hint as to why. I could go on but I am going to stop now. Maybe I am just not the intended reader for this book but I do not recommend this book.I give this book One out of Five stars.

I had such high hopes that even though Ryan made mistakes that the true love he felt for Annie would prevail.I liked that Annie was able to pull herself together but I feel like she settled for Justin. Yes, I totally believed she eventually fell in love with him but what she and Ryan shared should have made it too the end and I was sad it didn't.All that being said, I couldn't stop reading it and finished it in a matter of hours.

It provides solid, sensible advice on building motivation in order to get started and to keep going on that plan in order to get visible results. It examines the primary psychological reasons underlying why human beings falter on their exercise schemes and provides tips and advice as to how to tackle these self imposed barriers. One key motivation building tip that is often overlooked in other books, is the enhancement of the fun factor, and the need for creation of an optimal environment customized to one's individual needs, to keep one's will power going. The author provides an example of how the above considerations helped an acquaintance of his to fit successfully, a tough jogging schedule into a busy working day.If you're looking for actual exercises and dietary regimes for fast weight loss, this book is not for you.

A22M4RQ3L7QFIA,Craving4books,"Positively Mine is a story about a college girl who got pregnant and forced to make decisions she wasn't prepared for. It's a story about growing up, struggling with day-to-day reality of unplanned pregnancy.I read Positively Mine a few months ago and was shocked by the effect it had on me. I couldn't even write a review because I was afraid it'd be too emotional. Maybe because it's beautifully written, and you can feel the write's voice and can't help loving it. And the characters are so real and familiar, they could be your neighbors. I was with Laurel all the way throughout the book, struggling with accepting and dealing with the consequences of one night.There is also a mystery about the baby's father. I was dying to know who he was and why Laurel wouldn't share the news with him. I totally got the part why she struggled with telling her father (who wouldn't?). Her relationship with her father is complicated; she finds it hard to open up to him, especially learning about how he's been moving on with his life after she left for college.I remember finishing this book in one sitting and telling my daughter that it should be read by every teen girl. It could be a real eye opener about how real this situation feel.I have to warn all cliffhanger haters, there is a huge cliffhanger at the end. But as much as I usually dislike those, the way Christine Duval wrote it makes you hope for something good to happen.And if I wasn't convincing enough that this book is a great read... I read it 7 months ago and must have read at least a hundred other books after.

A2ZFOF8BYA5RD7,Pumitq,"Let me start by saying that I totally loved the stories in this series centering on Lexie and Jake.  However, I had NO interest in the prequel, or the stories dealing with Tiffany, so since the series was sold individually I only purchased the books that interested me.  Imagine my surprise when I realized that to read the end of Jake & Lexie's story, I had to purchase stories I had already bought and/or had no interest in reading.This practice is a complete rip-off, the series was sold individually, so the reader should have the option to buy ""When A Man Loves A Woman"" individually too, (since it is the end of the Jake/Lexie saga). I find this practice very unethical, and in my opinion it should be illegal as well.  This is the reason (mentioned above) that I gave the whole series only 1 star, even though I adored the following books: ""Big Girls Don't Cry"", ""In The Still of the Night"", and ""Every Breath You Take"".UP-DATE TO MY REVIEW:  It was brought to my attention that I could of gotten the ending for free if I had emailed the author, something I would never do, I just do not trust that practice.  And I still STRONGLY feel that if the series had been sold individually, the ending should also had been sold individually too.  Or at the very least the buyer should of been given the choice to either email the author and get the ending for free or allow the reader to purchase the ending.

The fifth one I published following Brian G Johnson's 6 step formula. I have had this document for a while now in PDF format and the one question I always asked myself was ""Why didn't Brian publish this in Kindle format?"". It sounds daft, but if I am in front of a computer, I'm there to work, not to read. The main way I read Brian's document was by printing it out and then carrying the stapled together pieces of paper around with me. Ideally, I like to read books sitting under a tree on a sunny day. A book is best, a Kindle is pretty good too, a bunch of paper is OK...sort of. So it came as a wonderful surprise to see Bill and Julie's take on their version of Brian's 6 step formula in Kindle format.Bill and Julie are students of Brian G Johnson and go through the 6 step formula with their own examples of books they have published. There also seems to be quite a good input from Brian himself too, which is great. They expand quite a lot on some of Brian's ideas such as how your title can affect the assigned URL you get for your book. I'd never thought about that properly!Overall the great thing about this book is that it adheres to the Kindle guidelines with the aim of producing a great product and marketing it well.

A50LN5MW404Z6,"Dennis Fleming ""Author: She Had No Enemies: A...","Burnout is bad from the perspective of the person on fire, so to speak. Fatigue, lack of sleep, depression--it's like having your first newborn. You don't know what to expect, when you'll sleep, what's around the corner. The stress of not knowing what's next can itself tear you up mentally and physically. (I released stress over my infant, by screaming into a pillow.) Bobby Hutchinson ups the ante by burning herself out over her husband Al's health. God, how could that happen? Well, it does, and it is not a Mickey Mouse story. Read this short, you'll get the metaphor.Ms. Hutchinson does a remarkable job in bringing us into her dilemma honestly, and sometimes humorously, never bust-out laughingly. This is not a hilarious recounting, more laughs than pathos. It's not a depressing one either. That's a precarious position for a writer, and the author balances herself brilliantly. Yeah, I said ""brilliantly."" This can't be overstated. (I like saying that about another writer. Not without some effort to come by in the POD arena.)Insight in this story is presented directly and matter-of-factually. Considering the subject, I'm a little stunned at the style's effectiveness. Hutchinson presents a well-known celebrity's dilemma, then asks if said celebrity's caregiver ever wanted to just pack it in. My answer: ""In moments of frustration, he probably did feel that way. Who wouldn't? But who would? Show me."" And it is here that one piece of information that would normally deflate the writing, raises it's head. We definitely know the end of the story. I'd rather have been wondering. But it makes for a clever title, and despite this spoiler, Ms. Hutchinson manages to kick it aside and keep the focus on her conflicts. What else would a good writer do?I've been depressed, clinically, suicidally, so I know deep psychological, physical, and emotional pain. Coming to that condition by attending to someone you love is cruel, as Bobby Hutchinson will tell you, and as a writer, she will show you. It's similar to suddenly losing someone, but maybe worse. I lost my youngest sister to a serial killer. That was a nuclear explosion, and the fallout (sounds like burnout) spread and contaminated my family and everyone we knew. After a great deal of self-destructive behavior--and therapy for me--we pulled through. The ugliness eventually tapered off, and I'll say what many in my position will say: there is no closure, and it takes something bigger that oneself to forgive. How can the author's story be worse? It is the slow burn, its intensity increasing.Pain from sudden loss is a detonation. It takes you by surprise, and the agony takes a long time to burn off. The situation in TILL DISEASE DO US PART is a long trail of fire that slowly burns toward a barrel of gasoline, until the protagonist prays for the explosion. Instead of the initial shock and road to recovery, the author experiences initial sadness, which eats away at her until the stress dial is at 11 on a 10 scale.Despite the artful handling of this mini-memoir, it left me wanting. I don't mind, because I've never finished a story wondering how it would read from the other main character's point of view. TILL DISEASE DO US PART makes me hunger for Al's take on events. This too can be done with memoir. Might be more challenging, but it could be done. I would love to read it, or any other work by this writer. By the way, there is a hint at the end of the book of Al's frame of mind about his wife's final decision. Please don't go there. It's a nice little spark igniting a different type of fire.",Burnout Fallout,"06 26, 2013",5

But with Finding Faith I was able to relate to the story more. Especially with Faith. Maybe that's why I like it better? I can definitely say I fell in love with Finn! I didn't think it was possible since Zeke was a great male character. The author sure writes amazing hero's! The male characters she writes are men that I could see myself falling for. I can't wait for the next book in the series. If a book is written by Tabatha Vargo, I won't hesitate to purchase it. She proves time and time again why I love reading. If I had one complaint about the book it would be that I didn't want it to end. :)",Didn't think it could get better..but it did!,"10 26, 2013",5

This 'book' illustrates everything that is wrong with self publishing. There's nothing new to be found in it, nothing that already hasn't been done by much better writers. The writing is amateurish and the story is a disjointed series of, ""I did this"" then ""I did that."" Character development is nil. It's obvious that no thought or research was put into this effort. It was quickly thrown together and never edited. Just a few examples of the problems with this book, the protagonist has a friend who's dad is something of a hunter and survivalist, yet he lets a 17 year old kid run the show and make all the plans. Now this is a kid who seems to be constantly tearing down the barricades he quickly put up so he can open windows to crawl out of or throw things through. He crawls up onto the roof to tack a sign up with no mention of a hammer. He then slides down the chimney like some freakish Santa Claus. Has the author never heard of a chimney flue? Then there's the problem of the next door neighbors zombie father. He breaks in the window on the front door, partially hanging into the house. We never find out what happens to him. How did the protagonist deal with the zombie dad? He simply disappears. Those are just a few of the problems that are rampant in this story.

The contents on the pages made me want to move in and live in the author&#8217;s mind. Rainy Kaye has written a fascinating and unique world where genies exist, but they certainly aren&#8217;t like what you see in the movies or in children&#8217;s tales. A kid&#8217;s book, this ain&#8217;t. ;)I will admit that Dimitri took a little getting used to. The book opens with him kidnapping someone and admitting that MURDER is easier to do than a kidnapping. What kind of human thinks that like?!? He&#8217;s a complicated and multi-faceted character, and a pleasure to read about. He&#8217;s a Djinn, and the fairy tales you read as a child didn&#8217;t prepare you for this adventure. Poor Dimitri has to put up with so much&#8230;a master who summons him at every whim, forcing him to commit atrocious acts of violence and murder. I loved hating Sylvia and Karl, the puppet masters holding Dimitri&#8217;s strings, so to speak. At first, the wishes seem random, but there&#8217;s a mystery to solve here, and I relished figuring out what was going on at the same time Dimitri did.Rainy Kaye gives the reader just enough information to make you think you know what&#8217;s going to happen, then she pulls the rug out from under your feet with plot twists that make you go &#8220;WHOA!&#8221; but in a good way. I found myself reading until late to find out what was going to happen next because I was so invested in the story.I was very sad when I read the last page because I knew I&#8217;d have to wait for the next book.

A15E91BFJKM4TS,Amazon Customer,"PLEASE NOTE: This is a good read for both FIBROMYALGIA and CFS sufferers.Yes, the author, Dan Neuffer, was afflicted with CFS/Fibro for years, but through his own research was able to overcome his CFS/Fibro. He is/was a physicist, so the first half of the book is a but heavy in the science behind his theory of the cause of CFS, but it is still worth the read. I didn't understand it ALL but I got the gist of it, and a LOT of it did relate to info I have already heard and read about over the years, so it did give me the confidence that I am on the right track and to keep reading the book. And I agree with the author, though its not easy to understand ALL the science, do NOT skip that part of the book, it helps to even semi-understand or be semi-familiar with the science part before you start treating.The author does emphasize throughout the book that it is up to YOU to help YOURSELF, and I think some people get offended by that. But it is true, when you are ready to tackle it, only you can help yourself, find the right resources, listen to your body, and help heal yourself. Yes, you employ the help of doctors and naturopaths, supplements, food, diet, exercise, meditation, life balancing techniques, but it IS up to YOU to take control and define your healing destiny. His book is an excellent guide as to WHAT (the cause) you are treating, and the overall key elements to hit -- again let me emphasize it is an overall program managing stress, diet, sleep, exercise, maintaining a positive attitude and outlook and creating a healthy life balance to move forward with.It all may sound very simple, and yes, it is simple and logical once you read this, but again it really helped me to understand WHY yoga has helped, and WHY the supplements that I take have helped me with feeling better, and WHY cutting out certain foods has helped me, and it provided me MORE guidelines to tweak and move forward with. And again it gave me confidence that I am on the right track to feeling much better!I highly recommend this read, and I REALLY wish doctors would read this.

Weird. The information is all basic and a lot of it is basically wrong, too. A calorie is not a calorie -- different foods with the same calories will affect the body differently. The use of the word skinny and also one of the first descriptions as &#34;sexy&#34; makes me wonder where this authors head is. The focu s is less on health and more on looking a certain way. Also, telng people they can eat whatever they want is bad advice. Finally, I was offended by the male author's repeated reference to housewives being lazy by using things like vacuums. Very Dark Ages. First off, housewives are not the only creatures who clean, and using women as an example of those who don't do enough..please. How about men who sit around playing video games all day? The author has some kind of problem with females with his sexist language, targeting women and insinuating that housewives are all taking it easy by not using brooms. Ultimately, the book is not expert advice as the author is so quick to remind us. So why write the book?

AMBD4WKKXDPIF,"Sharon S. Chalk ""mageverse""","I got this first book free and enjoyed it but when I saw that books 2 and 3 were $2.99 for 19 pages each,I passed,then I saw that it was bundled and thought maybe it would be worth it to get all it was either 4 or 5 books bundles,until I saw that it was $6.59 for 79 pages.That is ridiculous,I mean that is almost a $1 a page and while the first book (19 pages I believe) I thought it was free because it was so short,but Im sorry to pay that much money for a story that only has 79 pages which is close to a chapter or two in a real book is just not worth it.It dismays me because I enjoy Emma's books but I guess in the future I will just be getting her first book which is free in all her series and never get to read the ending on any of them,because I checked them out and they are all like that,I think even 99 cents is too much for 19 pages,but I would pay that because I enjoy her books,but until the prices are lowered Im afraid I won't be buying any of her books,what you get it not worth the hard earned money to spend on it.",way overpriced on all her books except for the free one you get to get you to start the series,"12 16, 2013",1

A2EROLHNRQ09CY,Judge Tabor,"This little book had very interesting characters, however I felt the story line was too simplistic and altogether predictable. Although, I must confess that I found myself searching for what I had hoped would be the second book about the Darent family - Georgie's and dare we hope, Sinclair's story.  Since there is only this one book and no information on the author available, at least not on Amazon, I suppose I will have to wait and see what happens.Normally, this is a book I would file in my collections under ""miscellaneous regency romance"" - however, since I will definitely purchase Georgie's book if it becomes available, I gave this author her own collection title.  If Ms. Knightly can come up with a slightly more complex story line in her books, it will make all the difference.  Her book was well written, especially if this is indeed her first effort.","Great Character Potential - However, Story Line Was Too Simplistic And Predictable","10 27, 2013",3

AEEJGJUZR9HJR,Shelly Hammond,"This is a great collection of short stories by a bunch of different authors.  You can read them during the holiday season but you really don't have to.  Some are about the holidays, some about the season, and some just have snow in them.  So really, you can read them any time you'd like and they will fit in perfectly!If you follow any of the works from these authors, it's likely you will run into familiar characters or styles of writing that you are used to already.  If not, you may decide to look into some of the authors further and find more of their longer works.  This is easy to do since after the short stories there is mention as to where the story would fit if it has characters from other books and where to find more information and books from the author.  I found a few authors that I am going to look up after reading their short stories in this book.A good many of the stories will have you laughing throughout and some will have you dropping your jaw when you get to the end, but all will leave you glad that you took the time to pick up this collection of stories.

A2VXSQHJWZAQGY,Sandy Milan,"I'm busy clearing out my TBR folder and finally got around to this one but truly if I hadn't gotten it for free, I'd be annoyed. Clearly the author wanted to set up a series that I won't be reading because this book put me off so much. The amount of drama in one relationship had me wishing that the h would just wise up and ditch the guy.A brief summary from my point of view since there seem to be a lot of 'friendly' reviews. The h has been married to the H for a year but only as a marriage of convenience. When she tells him she loves him then he says he wants a divorce as he's made a vow never to love again. Yes, it's been done thousands of times but I actually still like marriage of convenience stories if they are well told. The problem with this book is that we are only given the details I've given here, later on in the book so actually it's all a bit confusing. The more I read about the H, the less I liked him and thought him a total ass. It didn't improve and as I said I thought the h made a mistake in not ditching him. If you want the reasons why I'm going to give them in the spoilers below.+++Spoilers+++The H had supposedly always been in love with the H but because of a misunderstanding/stupid conflict he goes and marries the h's best friend after he gets her pregnant. Granted the h was no longer friends with the girl but the H doesn't know that because he never asks. This after them being best friends. The more things are uncovered the more I hate him. He marries her because he wants to get his daughter away from his druggie ex-wife so basically he uses the h. This becomes very clear when he gives his reasons for marrying her. The h had been planning to seduce him when they were still young but the H gets very sick and the best friend comes between them. He found out what she wanted to do but he still goes ahead and sleeps with the best friend because the h is leaving for college. But this isn't the worst part, because much later in the book the h finds out that her younger sister and the H lost their virginity to each other one drunken night, even though he was in love with the h. There is loads more stuff that I can go into but really it would just be pointless.If you still go ahead and buy this book then don't say you weren't warned.",I really didn't like this book,"01 1, 2014",1

A2PCTRUN04RK21,smk,"The Billionaire's Son (Parts 1-4) is a great erotica. It has a very interesting story line. There's lots of hidden details that only the character knows, and ""You"" as the reader must continue to read to find out what the character knows that you don't. Here's my only issue with these short stories. I got part 1 to this erotica for $0.99. It was so good I paid $5.99 to have parts 1-4, (not a problem, well worth the $5.99. But don't forget to include my $0.99 I paid for just part 1 to see if I would like it, or not.) The problem lays in the fact that part 5 is $2.99 and is only 26 pages long. Parts 6-8 are also less then 40 pages and cost $2.99 each. I'm hoping the author gets to read this and will lower her cost on these next parts, because I have no intention of spending that much for a short story. I would pay $0.99 each though. If you have no problem spending $17.95 for 8 short stories, (less then 40 pages each) then I would recommend buying it, because they are good short erotic stories, but as for me I'll wait and hope the author lowers her price.","Love the book, BUT there is one thing you should be aware of","04 6, 2013",5

Instead of just acting quickly or impulsively, I have found that if I take 5-10 minutes to really think through the decision and all the different possibilities, that most of the time there is a more strategic and better course of action for the goals I am trying to achieve.
