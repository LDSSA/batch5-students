Since there are a lot of people talking about my window size, instead of replying individually to everyone I'll just say it here - it's just personal preference. I don't really enjoy playing with a big screen, and I feel that I don't perform as well when doing so. I kinda like being able to see my surroundings without really having to move my eyes too much (or at all), and am very used to the SQM size of this particular size. I also enjoy having a bigger chat, but that's just a nice bonus, I mainly do it for the screen's size. Too used to it by now, I guess! \n\nI apologize if it made the video uncomfortable to watch for some of you. Fullscreen should make it much better, but if you're on a phone, it really would suck, so, sorry bout that! \n\nI usually do my videos [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dcf5x3wpV3Q), the only reason I've been uploading my hunting videos with the entire screen is so you guys can see the Hunt Analyzer, Preys, stuff like that.

I just got done reading through this thread and a 3.9 GPA is extremely strong for a community college. Most CC's(Community College's) will have you take a placement tests and that will determine which class levels to take. In an ideal world you would have a good chunk of change saved up for life after the corps and use that to pay for CC Courses and you would crash at your parents place. Once your done with your Core Classes and begin your transfer to a University and start using your GI bill. If you apply for FAFSA you can also opt to do a work study which gives you a chance to work &lt;20 hours per week at the University as a side job. Being a MCWIS you should be able to land a life guard job no problem. \n\n\nPaying for Community College with the GI Bill can seem like a waste if you can pay for it out of pocket.

{"author":"xSQUALLx","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"body":"So yeah. Late last year I was travelling through Japan with some friends of mine (I tend to goto Japan for a few weeks every year) \n\nOn this occasion I met this lovely 38 year old woman named Hiroko at a cocktail bar in Kyoto. I noticed her looking my way a few times but I couldn't tell if it was good or bad because, well I'm a bigger guy and in Japan it's already a big disadvantage lol \n\nWith the power of a little liquid courage I managed to walk past her as I went to the to the bar and as I walked back I managed to make a little joke about the drink she had (wish I did in English, that could've been a waste of time lol) thankfully she saw the humor to it and asked where I am from \n\nSo we sat and spoke for a bit, found out she actually visited my city with her now ex husband a few years ago. So we already had some common ground. In the middle of chatting causally we were making cheeky jabs at each other too so I could tell there was something there. Her girlfriends arrived and so we exchanged Line IDs and went our seperate ways.\n\nNow I didnt think this would go anywhere, because I was going to Osaka the next day. But we spoke for a couple days on Line before she asked me straight up if I wanted to spend some time with her on the weekend. Of course I jumped at the opportunity and booked us an Airbnb.\n\nShe caught the train in from Kyoto and she was wearing this cute little outfit that and a little bow tie lol but she made it look cute. We headed back the Airbnb where wow it had an incredible view of Osaka Castle. \n\nWe sat down on the couch to rest our feet and she didnt waste much time. She told me she was excited because she had never been with a \"western man\" before (whether thats true or not, i dont give a shit) and went straight to unzipping my pants and reaching into grab my cock. With a smile on her face she looked and me and said \"very big\" (now for record, she's clear fan servicing. Im not overly big in that area at all. Probably just abit over average in length, pretty girthy though)\n\nShe told me stand up and when i did she ripped my pants down and got to her knees infront of me and started service my cock. Her gorgeous dark eyes staring up at me while she tried her best to deep throat my cock was mind blowing. Not only this, she was very attentive to my sensitive spots and would torture me with them and giggle at the sight of me shaking. \n\nAfter I came I was hard again a few minutes later and ready to feel her little Japanese pussy. She layed out on the bed and I got the tip of my cock slightly in before she pushed me back and told me no! No..no? I couldnt understand, she then smirked and stood up and whispered in my earth \"you must wait\" she got dressed and told me to get my clothes on too because she wanted to have dinner.\n\nI stood there with my throbbing cock, confused and aroused haha this woman was teasing the fuck out of me and I loved it. So we went back out for a couple of hours and had dinner before heading back to the airbnb. The whole time all I could think about we fucking her brains out, I think this is exactly what she wanted.\n\nWe finally get back. She has a shower straight away and tells me to have one after her. After mine, i come out and see her on the bed wearing thigh highs and nothing else. They were pinching in her skin ever so much that it caused a slight dimple in the skin, so hot!\n\nShe sits down on the bed and gestures me over and stops me when im leaning down to kiss her. She puts her hand on my head and pushes me down so i am level with her pussy and demands me to eat it and you bet I did. Her pussy tasted incredible and I could tell from sliding a finger into her pussy that it was gonna be tough when my cock was going to enter.\n\nAfter willingly complying to her demands and eating her pussy she told me that i had waited long enough and now i was allowed to enter her. We started with her on her back and her holding her legs back. It took abit of work and some lube, but that moment of penetration where her eyes shut tight, mouth gasped, head back and hands gripped the blanket beneath her is an image and feeling i'll never forget.\n\nI had to work her tight pussy slowly to begin with though and as she became more used to my girth she started to push against me and as my cock pushed a little further in each time she would let out a sigh. When we finally worked it in and we could build up a good rhythm it was amazing. This gorgeous Japanese woman taking my cock and shaking and one put she was moaning so hard i could see a vessel form on her forehead before she finally gasped for air and let go of the blankets.\n\nAfter seeing her let go i decided to lean down and scoop her up. Her legs dangling over my arms and i held onto her cute little ass. She put her arms around my neck and held on while I pounded fuck out of her pussy but she could only handle this for a couple of minutes because it was beginning to hurt.\n\nSo I placed her back onto the bed on all fours and teased her pussy and clit from behind with my cock before slowling re-entering her incredible pussy. With her thrust in she would push back. Her ass was the tight little thing but enough meat for me to grab a handful with each hand and pound away her. \n\nThere was a moment I looked up and realised how cool everything was about this too as i looked out the window and saw osaka castle lit up and i stopped for a moment, still inside her and told her to look too. She shared the same enthusiasm of how cool this experience was. We went back to push each others sexual limits and fucking like animals for the rest of night.\n\nWe lazed around in bed together the next morning before we had a couple more rounds of sex and then check out. We got brunch. Went to some cool bamboo forest and shrines. We said our goodbyes and that was that. We still keep in touch but we are both busy. Hopefully when I'm in Japan next we'll be able to hook up again :)","can_gild":true,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1506816050,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"id":"dnqil9c","is_submitter":true,"link_id":"t3_73igc4","parent_id":"t3_73igc4","permalink":"/r/AsiansGoneWild/comments/73igc4/my_time_with_a_mature_japanese_lady_story_in/dnqil9c/","retrieved_on":1509189626,"score":9,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AsiansGoneWild","subreddit_id":"t5_2wm0g"}

{"author":"valuedota","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"body":"2) Mechanics is basically reaction time similar to gun skill.  All that you listed is relevant with one additional important note.  In Dota you acquire two resources: gold and experience.  You get these resources in three ways, killing creeps, killing enemy heroes, and killing towers.  In the early game killing creeps is the most important way to get these resources. The mid lane is as close at it gets to a fair fight (its a neutral lane not closer to either teams base and historically was played as a 1v1 contest) so there is a lot of contesting over last hits (also known as CS).  So people that find success in the mid lane tend to have really good reactions to win these 1v1s.  Also a lot of mid heroes are \"flashy\" with fast movement based abilities.  So you usually want your most mechanically talented player located there.\n\n3) The offlaner is probably the most vulnerable (its sometimes called the hard lane) since you are usually playing 1 vs 2 or 3 heroes.  But mid and the mid tower are often a very important early advantage and the focus of a lot of action early on in the game.  Since you can teleport to towers and they give vision the mid tower (with its neutral central location) is a very important objective to open up space on the opponents side of the map.\n\nRecently the \"new meta\" has been the position 4 player sitting mid, turning mid into a duel lane vs its historical 1v1.  The nice thing about Dota is that there aren't really fixed positions for how you set up your lanes.  Every team will send 1 hero to each lane, but what you do with your two supports depends on draft and strategy.  You can go aggro and send them all to the offlane, you can have 1 in the safe lane and 1 roam, etc.  \n\n4) Depends on the team, a lot of times coaches in Dota are picked up right before a LAN since they are often pro players that didn't qualify for the LAN.  For instance Pajkatt was the coach of DC during their TI6 2nd place run (Misery's team) since his team wasn't able to qualify.","can_gild":true,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1506816061,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"id":"dnqilik","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_73hm7y","parent_id":"t1_dnqhpk8","permalink":"/r/OpTicGaming/comments/73hm7y/dota_your_new_dota_boys_and_the_roles_they_play/dnqilik/","retrieved_on":1509189631,"score":5,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"OpTicGaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2xpuo"}
