    "# Part 1 - Information Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Information extraction (IE) is the task of automatically extracting structured information from unstructured and/or semi-structured machine-readable documents. Information Extraction may be presented in three subtasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Named Entity Recognition**, retrieve entities (like Person, Location, etc.) in the text. \n",
    "* **Relation Extraction**, find the relation between two entities in the text.\n",
    "* **Template Filling**, find the correct entity to fill a certain template, for instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this BLU we are going to learn some of the basic techniques to extract specific (pre-specified) information from textual sources. From the three specified tasks, we are going to **focus on the task of named-entity recognition (NER)** where our objective is to **retrieve all the mentions** of entities like people, locations, time, among others. The other two are mentioned for the sake of completeness and you should definitely research more about them, specially if you're eager to learn more about NLP.\n",
