# Big Learning Unit 8 -  Feature Modeling and Dimensionality Reduction NLP

## What is in this BLU?

This is the second big learning unit of the text classification specialization. It will introduce you to common tools and methods for selecting the most informative text features from a corpus and for avoiding the "curse of dimensionality."

#### Main topics

- Feature relevance and chi squared 
- Dimensionality reduction
- Word embeddings

## How to go through this BLU

1. Follow the [Learning Unit Workflow](https://github.com/LDSSA/batch5-students#learning-unit-workflow) to setup your environment.
Don't forget to install the requirements using the `requirements.txt` file for this BLU!
2. Additionally, creating the environment should install an extra file for part 3 and the exercises, but to install it manually run:

   ```
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_md
   ```
3. Go through the Learning Notebooks (there's three of them).
4. Do the Exercise notebook, and submit it on [the portal](https://portal.lisbondatascience.org), as usual.
