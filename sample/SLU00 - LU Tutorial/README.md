# Small Learning Unit 00 - Learning Unit Tutorial

This learning unit is meant to be a tutorial that has instructors as the audience but can be read by both students
and instructors. For instructors, you can follow the directions step-by-step in the instructor version of this
repo and treat it as a complete reference on how to build learning material.

If you are a student reading this in the student version of the repo, you can read through this anyway and
actually do the exercises. Although the audience is for the instructors, it should still give you an idea of
how to go through LUs and what to expect from them.

You can get the presentation template from here TODO

The READMEs should also contain a list of topics that are covered in the LU. See SLU01 for an example of how to 
write one of these READMEs correctly.
